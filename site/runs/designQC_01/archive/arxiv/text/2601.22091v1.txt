Interacting spin systems in solids underpin a wide range of quantum technologies, from quantum
sensors and single-photon sources to spin-defect-based quantum registers and processors. We develop
a quantum-computer-aided framework for simulating such devices using a general electron spin
resonance Hamiltonian incorporating zero-field splitting, the Zeeman effect, hyperfine interactions,
dipole-dipole spin-spin terms, and electron-phonon decoherence. Within this model, we combine
Gray-encoded qudit-to-qubit mappings, qubit-wise commuting aggregation, and a multi-reference
selected quantum Krylov fast-forwarding (sQKFF) hybrid algorithm to access long-time dynamics
while remaining compatible with NISQ and early fault-tolerant hardware constraints. Numerical
simulations demonstrate the computation of autocorrelation functions up to ∼100 ns, together
with microwave absorption spectra and the ℓ1-norm of coherence, achieving 18-30% reductions
in gate counts and circuit depth for Trotterized time-evolution circuits compared to unoptimized
implementations. Using the nitrogen vacancy center in diamond as a testbed, we benchmark the
framework against classical simulations and identify the reference-state selection in sQKFF as the
primary factor governing accuracy at fixed hardware cost. This methodology provides a flexible
blueprint for using quantum computers to design, compare, and optimize solid-state spin-qubit
technologies under experimentally realistic conditions.

INTRODUCTION
Solid state materials embedded with spin-active de-
fects are increasingly attracting attention for their po-
tential applications as quantum sensors, single-photon
sources, quantum processors and more. The search for
new spin defects and suitable host materials is an ac-
tive area of research, where candidate systems must al-
low for precise manipulation and readout and permit long
coherence times [1–4]. Among these systems, nitrogen-
vacancy (NV) centers have emerged as a leading plat-
form due to their long coherence, dephasing, and relax-
ation times, which can be further extended through tech-
niques such as Ramsey and Hahn echo sequences [5, 6].
Nevertheless, the complex spin–environment interactions
and internal spin couplings pose significant challenges for
classical modeling and analysis [7, 8]. Digital quantum
computer-aided design [9, 10] offers a promising alter-
native, enabling the investigation of essential properties,
such as the coherence times of arbitrary states, the study
of system dynamics under realistic experimental condi-
tions, and the numerous useful properties which may
be computed using these dynamics, including absorption
spectra and more.
More broadly, the simulation of quantum systems [11]
stands as one of the most promising applications of
quantum computing, alongside drug discovery [12, 13],
communications [14, 15], optimization [16, 17], machine
learning [18–20], and cryptography [21, 22]. Neverthe-
less, current quantum technologies still operate within
the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, tran-
sitioning toward early fault-tolerant devices, where lim-

ited resources and intrinsic noise constrain hardware
[23, 24]. Therefore, a central research direction is the de-
velopment of efficient algorithms that can approximate
the time evolution of quantum systems while minimizing
the required computational resources. Key optimization
metrics include the number of single- and multi-qubit
gates, qubit counts, and circuit depth, thereby mitigating
restrictions imposed by various sources of noise [25, 26].
Spin Hamiltonians serve as coarse-grained models in
chemistry and materials science, capturing collective
magnetic interactions in a simplified form.
When cal-
ibrated with accurate parameters, such effective mod-
els can reproduce complex phenomena, yet they remain
many-body in nature and are generally intractable for
classical computation.
A prominent example is the
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spin Hamiltonian,
which has become a focus of recent quantum simulation
efforts on gate-based processors.
A recent demonstra-
tion of quantum advantage, for instance, demonstrated
that simulation of higher-order out-of-time-ordered cor-
relators (OTOCs) is likely beyond the reach of classi-
cal supercomputers [27]. They later showed that OTOC
data harvested from NMR experiments in what they call
many-body nuclear spin echo sequences may be used
to train parameterized OTOC in an NMR Hamiltonian
learning setup to extract molecular geometric informa-
tion [28, 29].
While NMR-type models have provided
a valuable testbed for quantum simulation, the electron
spin resonance (ESR) Hamiltonian, which we explore in
this work, extends this paradigm by incorporating both
electronic and nuclear spins along with spin–phonon in-
teractions.
Together, our approach describes a collection of inter-
acting spin defects distributed inside a real solid with
vibrational degrees of freedom. This class of ESR spin-
defect models, which underpins platforms like the NV

FIG. 1. The quantum computer-aided design framework proposed in this work. The process begins by defining a
quantum system (a) by specifying spin-defect species, the host material, the presence of nuclear spin species, applied
magnetic fields, and the geometry of the spin ensemble (configurations 1, 2, and 3 in Table I are examples of such a
specification). Next, the system Hamiltonian is constructed, with its parameters obtained either computationally or
experimentally, as depicted in (b). With the Hamiltonian defined, the sQKFF algorithm can be executed by specifying
the system’s initial state. (c) is divided into two parts: the quantum component, which computes the elements of the
H and S matrices via Hadamard tests and performs the optimization step through QWC aggregation; and the classical
component, which solves the Schr¨odinger equation within the Krylov subspace. Finally, as shown in (d), the outputs
of (c) enable the estimation of quantum resource requirements and the computation of key system properties such as
the system’s autocorrelation function, microwave absorption spectrum, and time-dependent ℓ1-norm of coherence of
other dynamics-derived properties.
center, has received comparatively little attention in the
quantum simulation literature despite its application to
realistic quantum technologies. Only very recently have
studies begun exploring quantum algorithms for simu-
lating spin defects in solids [30–32], often by tackling
the full electronic structure problem (or a reduced elec-
tronic structure problem by utilizing embedding theories
[33, 34]) at great computational cost. By contrast, focus-
ing on an ESR Hamiltonian with an effective spin–boson
coupling, as we do in this work, is far more economi-
cal in quantum resources than treating electron–phonon
interactions from first principles, yet can retain the es-
sential physics needed to design and optimize spin-based
quantum technologies.
In this work, we present a framework for simulat-
ing and characterizing spin defects in solid-state mate-
rials, enabling deeper analysis of current experimental
platforms and exploration of new candidates for next-
generation quantum technologies. As illustrated in Fig.
1, the methodology integrates techniques optimized for
computational efficiency on existing quantum hardware
and is validated across three distinct NV−center con-
figurations.
The procedure begins by defining a spin
defect system in a particular material, whose Hamil-
tonian parameters are either taken from experimental
data or computed using classical methods on a high
performance computer.
We then encode the system’s
Hamiltonian into a spin-1/2 representation for time-
evolution simulation and computation of relevant prop-
erties. However, operational quantities such as coherence
and dephasing times manifest over long timescales, from
nanoseconds to microseconds [5], making conventional
approaches such as the Trotter–Suzuki decomposition
computationally unfeasible [35]. Hybrid algorithms have

emerged to address this limitation by fast-forwarding
time evolution with fewer resources [36–40].
Among
them, the multi-reference, selected Quantum Krylov Fast-
Forwarding (sQKFF) algorithm [41] offers a practical ap-
proach by extending its dependence from the simulated
time to the number of reference states used to approx-
imate long-time dynamics, while significantly reducing
key metrics such as gate count and circuit depth. Our
framework further integrates an optimization stage based
on qubit-wise commuting (QWC) aggregation [42, 43],
which improves the reduction of resource requirements.
The remainder of this work is organized as follows.

the proposed framework, including key methodological
considerations and descriptions of the NV−configura-
tions used in numerical simulation. Section III presents
the results, focusing on the comparison between proper-
ties approximated using both the sQKFF algorithm and
QuTiP, including an analysis of the influence of vary-
ing the Trotterization error and the number of reference
states, R, in the sQKFF algorithm.
Resource estima-
tions are presented in this section. Section IV discusses
additional factors that may affect the results and outlines
potential directions for future research. Finally, Section
V summarizes the main findings and conclusions of this
work.

METHODS
A.
Hamiltonian Models for Spin-Defects
Simulations.
To ensure simulations closely resemble experimental
conditions, and thus support the prototyping of spin de-
fects in solid-state materials, the framework incorporates
a range of relevant interactions: from operational ones,
such as the coupling to external magnetic fields, to envi-
ronmental effects including lattice vibrations and nearby
spin impurities. In addition, recent lines of investigation
are moving towards designing Hamiltonians of materi-
als with desired properties [44], which, if expressed in
terms of Pauli strings, can also be simulated with the
present framework. A detailed discussion of the Hamil-
tonian terms used in this work can be found in [5, 7, 45].
In the remainder of this section, we present the Hamil-
tonian for a system of interacting NV−spin defects. The
same form applies to other spin-defect platforms and host
materials, with the appropriate choice of Hamiltonian pa-
rameters. To describe the dynamics of a system with N
NV−centers, the zero-field splitting and Zeeman terms,

These describe the electronic spins’ in-

gNV = 2.003 the NV g-factor, µB the Bohr magneton,
and ⃗Si = [Sx,i, Sy,i, Sz,i] the electronic spin-1 operator of
the i-th NV−center [5, 46].

and the 14N nuclear spin of the NV−centers is described

and ⃗Ii = [Ix,i, Iy,i, Iz,i] the spin-1 operator of the i-th
NV−center’s 14N nucleus [5, 46, 47]. Note that the Zee-
man and quadrupole terms in Eq. 2 correspond to the
dynamics of a 14N impurity within the lattice.
Since one of the primary sources of decoherence in spin
defects arises from coupling to lattice vibrations, an in-
teraction modeled through the spin–boson Hamiltonian

where ω is the phonon mode frequency, λ the coupling
strength, and b, b† the annihilation and creation oper-
ators. Notice that Eq. 3 corresponds to a boson bath
with a single vibration mode coupled to all NV−centers.
This Hamiltonian can be extended to include boson baths
with multiple vibration modes that can be coupled to
various spin elements within the considered layout. An
additional source of decoherence is nearby spins, such as
other NV−centers’ electronic spins or 14N impurities’
spins. This interaction is captured via the dipole–dipole
Hamiltonian, described by
ˆHdd = µ0α1α2

with µ0 the vacuum permeability; then, for each spin 1
and 2: α the product of their respective g-factor and
magneton, and ⃗S is their spin operator. These spins are
separated by an r distance, with ˆr the unitary direction
vector.
Evidently, a wide range of possible configurations ex-
ists within each platform, even within the specific case of
NV−centers, and our framework is designed to be appli-
cable across all such scenarios. As a testbed for analyz-
ing the influence of each interaction and enabling cross-
comparison, three distinct NV−configurations were sim-
ulated using the proposed framework, with their param-
eters summarized in Tab. I and their layouts sketched in
Fig. 2. To enable efficient simulation, the d-level Hamil-
tonians are mapped into a spin-1/2 representation us-
ing Gray encoding, yielding a qubit count that scales as
⌈log2(d)⌉[48].
B.
Qubit-wise Commuting Partitioning and Circuit
Optimization
The resulting Hamiltonian, ˆH, expressed as a sum of
Pauli strings, is partitioned into qubit-wise commuting
(QWC) groups. In each group, all terms commute within
corresponding qubit subspaces, allowing a set of single-
qubit Clifford rotations to simultaneously diagonalize the
group [42, 43]. This property is particularly useful when
implementing time evolution via Trotterization, as it en-
ables the use of canonical circuits for exponentiating the
diagonal Pauli strings [48].
The grouping further al-
lows optimal reordering of exponentials, so that adjacent
adjoint operations cancel, effectively reducing both the
number of gates and the overall circuit depth.
C.
The sQKFF algorithm
Once an efficient way to approximate the time evolu-
tion operator is determined, the sQKFF algorithm can be
applied. It yields an approximation of the time-evolved
state given by
|ψ(t)⟩= e−it ˆ
H/¯h |ψ0⟩≈

r=1
cmr(t) |ϕmr⟩,
(5)
with |ψ0⟩the initial state, cmr a time-dependent com-
plex coefficient, and |ϕmr⟩a reference state.
This ap-
proximation constructs the M-order Krylov subspace
with a number R of reference states.
These refer-
ence states have the form |ϕmr⟩= e−imτ ˆ
H |r⟩, where
|r⟩∈{|ψ0⟩, |B1⟩, · · · , |BR−1⟩}, and each Br denotes a
bitstring reference state, obtained by measuring the state
e−i(M−1)τ ˆ

Solving Eq. 6 is the classical component of the algo-
rithm, while the quantum component consists of evalu-
ating the matrix elements of S and H from Eq. 7, which
in this work were computed using Hadamard tests with
second-order Trotterizations to approximate the time-
evolution operator.
Cort´es and Gray [49] provide a bound for the sQKFF
parameter τ based on the spectral range of the Hamilto-
nian, ∆E, namely τ ≤
π¯h
∆E . Using this result and the fact
that ∥ˆH∥1 ≥∆E/2, where ∥ˆH∥1 denotes the Hamilto-
nian 1-norm, we set a tighter bound on τ to be τ ≤
π¯h
2∥ˆ
H∥1 .
Accordingly, we fixed τ =
π¯h
10∥ˆ
H∥1 and set M = 10. We
then tested three Trotterization error thresholds corre-
sponding to 9, 19, and 42 steps, as illustrated in Fig. 3.
For all three configurations, we evaluated the autocorre-
lation function C(t) = | ⟨ψ0|ψ(t)⟩|2 with R = 5, 10, 15,
where the reference states were chosen as the bitstrings
with the largest measurement probabilities from the state
e−i(M−1)τ ˆ
H |ψ0⟩, following the procedure in [41]. The ac-
curacy of the results was validated against time evolution
approximations obtained using QuTiP [50].
D.
Microwave Absorption Spectra Computation
via sQKFF
Most spin-defect-based platforms exhibit optical ac-
tivity when interacting with microwave magnetic fields.
This property forms the foundation of the Optical Detec-
tion of Magnetic Resonance (ODMR) technique, which
has been crucial in achieving precise measurements and
high-fidelity control over the spin quantum state. Spin
defects are promising candidates for quantum technolo-
gies due to the capacity to manipulate the spin state
reliably, e.g., via coupling to the magnetic component of
incident electromagnetic waves, combined with coherence
times long enough to apply these interactions effectively
[51].
Research focusing on the applications and operational
enhancement of spin defects through microwave and opti-
cal frequency interactions is highly active. The resulting
applications span a wide range of quantum technologies,
including quantum memories, scalable quantum comput-
ing and sensing, as well as enabling connections to pho-
tonic architectures for the implementation of quantum
networks [52–55]. Therefore, providing a way to calculate
the microwave absorption spectra would demonstrate the
operational utility of simulating these spin-defect-based
platforms, advancing the study and development of these
systems for quantum technologies.
Linear response applies when the perturbation is suf-
ficiently weak, and the system is initially in a stationary
state of ˆH0 (typically thermal equilibrium). We assume a
static bias field defining the ˆz quantization axis and probe
the system with a weak transverse oscillating magnetic
field,
ˆHP (t) = −Bx cos(ωt) ˆ
Mx.
(8)
In the long-wavelength limit λ ≫L, where L is the length
scale of the system of interest, the driving field is ef-
fectively uniform across the spin ensemble; this is the
magnetic dipole approximation, which we adopt in the
forthcoming. For NV−center configurations, ˆ
Mx is the
x-component of the total magnetic moment, including
the electronic spin operator ˆSx and nuclear spin opera-
tors ˆI(j)
x , with each contribution weighted by its gyro-
magnetic ratio.
The linear absorption spectrum is derived from the
imaginary part of the generalized susceptibility χ(ω),
which corresponds to the Fourier transform of the re-

The

ℓ1-norm of coherence with sQKFF
Assessing the coherence time of a quantum system
typically requires comparing the coherence of its time-
evolved state against that of the initial state. A plethora
of coherence measures have been proposed in the liter-
ature to quantify this basis-dependent resource [56–65].
Among these, one of the widely employed resource quan-
tifiers is the ℓ1-norm of coherence [58] due to its opera-
tional clarity.
Expressing the state of an n-qubit quantum system, ˆρ,
in the computational basis Θ ≡{|i⟩| i ∈{0, 1}n}, the
ℓ1-norm of coherence, denoted Cℓ1(ˆρ), is given by
Cℓ1(ˆρ) =
X
{i̸=j | i,j∈Θ}
| ⟨i| ˆρ |j⟩| .
(12)
From the above definition, it is evident that measuring
coherence is experimentally costly. For a density matrix
representing the state of the system, computing 22n −2n
off-diagonal parameters is required in the worst-case sce-
nario. Moreover, when studying dynamics, the cost es-
calates further, as coherence must be evaluated at every
time point. However, when the system evolves within a
Krylov subspace, this overhead can be significantly re-
duced.
The system studied in this work is a number N of NV−
centers coupled with an environment, which includes the
nuclear spins of each NV−center, the spin of 14N impu-
rities, and a phonon bath. Considering it as a bipartite
system composed of subsystems A, the NV−electronic
spins, and B, their environment, the time-evolved state
of the complete system is
|ψ⟩AB ≡|ψ(t)⟩= e−it ˆ
H/¯h |ψ0⟩,
(13)
which is approximated by Eq. 5. Then, in the Krylov
approximation, the ℓ1-norm as defined in Eq. 12 can be
expressed as
Cℓ1 (|ψ⟩⟨ψ|AB) =
X
{k̸=l | k,l∈Σ×Γ}

m′,r′

m′r′(t) ⟨k|ϕmr⟩⟨ϕm′r′|l⟩

,
(14)
with binary alphabets Σ and Γ for subsystems A and
B, respectively, such that their computational basis are
{|a⟩| a ∈Σ} and {|b⟩| b ∈Γ}.
Now, computing the coherence of the state at any time
is only dependent on classically obtaining c(t) from Eq. 6,
which doesn’t require an additional quantum effort pro-
vided we already solved the Krylov subspace problem.
The amplitudes of the corresponding computational ba-
sis states that compose the reference states |ϕmr⟩can
always be obtained via Hadamard tests, and remain the
same at all times t. However, since it is usual for ref-
erence states to be classically tractable, and we require
only inner products of these states with computational
basis bitstrings, the extra computational efforts required
to compute the ℓ1 norm are typically classical.
Thus,
while the process of computing the amplitudes may scale
exponentially with the number of qubits, all subsequent
coherence evaluations are efficient.
Tracing out the environment and rearranging terms
yields a simplified expression for computing the ℓ1 norm

Hence, the coherence of the subsystem’s evolved state
can be computed efficiently once the reference states’ am-
plitudes are known. As a direct consequence, within the
Krylov subspace, it is efficient to determine the time t
when the coherence of the system decays to 1/e of its
initial value, thus providing valuable information related
to effective T1 and T2 coherence times.

RESULTS,
The comparison of the microwave absorption spec-
tra of Configuration 1 is presented in Fig.
4, and it
demonstrates that even with low-accuracy Trotterization
thresholds, the spectra computed within our framework
provide reliable initial insights into the expected reso-
nance frequencies of the NV −system under external
perturbation, such as incident microwave photons.
As
anticipated, the agreement with the spectrum calculated
using QuTiP is improved by reducing the Trotterization
error and increasing the number of reference states, suc-
cessfully resolving all significant spectral peaks. Given
that the absorption spectrum characterizes the dynamic
response of the system to external fields, the high ac-
curacy achieved confirms the utility of our framework
for accurately calculating operational properties of these

spin defect-based platforms, which supports their study,
modeling, and advancement.
In addition, the results for the computation of the ℓ1-
norm of coherence for Configuration 1, shown in Fig. 5,
exhibit a dependence on both the Trotterization error εT
and the number of reference states R that is consistent
with the behavior observed for the microwave absorp-
tion spectra, Fig. 4. While reducing εT predictably im-
proves accuracy, increasing the number of reference states
emerges as an effective way to achieve accurate results at
operationally relevant timescales while maintaining fea-
sible quantum resource requirements. This observation
motivates further investigation into improved methods
for reference-state selection.
The results presented in Fig. 6 illustrate the influence
of εT and R on the performance of the sQKFF algorithm
when computing the autocorrelation functions. For Con-
figurations 1 and 3, these reproduce QuTiP results with
good accuracy up to several tens of nanoseconds. A re-
markable observation from these configurations is that
the autocorrelation function can be simulated with rea-
sonable precision for short times, approximately up to 20
nanoseconds, even when larger Trotterization errors are
used. This implies that shorter quantum circuits with
fewer gates can still yield meaningful results, thereby ex-
pediting computation. Nonetheless, increasing the num-
ber of reference states has a more pronounced effect,
improving both the accuracy of the simulation and the
achievable time span.
In particular, the results for Configuration 3 with
εT = 0.01922 and R = 15 are noteworthy. Despite in-
volving a more complex system with additional impuri-
ties, a larger number of qubits, and dipole–dipole inter-
actions with the NV−center, its autocorrelation function
exhibits a close agreement with the QuTiP results, com-
parable with that of Configuration 1, which represents
a smaller system.
These findings suggest that the se-
lection of reference states plays a more decisive role in
achieving accurate long-time dynamics than either the
Trotterization error, which in our framework relates to
the τ parameter, or system size. Consequently, a more
informed or adaptive selection of reference states, chosen
to better capture the relevant features of the long-time
evolution, could enable accurate simulations while sub-

TABLE II. Resource estimations for the Hadamard test circuit in all configurations, evaluated under different εT .
The column W [×104] reports the metric values without QWC aggregation, while G [×104] shows the corresponding
values when aggregation is applied. The ratio γ quantifies the relative reduction between W and G. The number of

stantially reducing the computational overhead on quan-
tum hardware.
The importance of reference state selection is sup-
ported by the results for Configuration 2 shown in Fig.
6. Owing to the larger system size, the set of measured
bitstrings from the state e−i(M−1)τ ˆ
H |ψ(t = 0)⟩with the
highest probabilities, from which the reference states are
selected, contains a substantially greater number of ele-
ments. As a result, information about the system dynam-
ics becomes more sparsely distributed across the possible
states, making it more difficult to identify reference states
that effectively capture the features relevant to long-time
dynamics.
Another factor distinguishing Configuration 2 from
Configurations 1 and 3 is the value of the Hamiltonian
1-norm.
For Configuration 2, we obtained ∥ˆH∥1/¯h =
112.265 GHz, whereas Configurations 1 and 3 yielded
62.1052 and 62.1124 GHz, respectively.
In our frame-
work, the Hamiltonian’s 1-norm directly influences the
sQKFF algorithm through the dependence of τ on ∥ˆH∥1,
which in turn affects the construction of the reference
states. This observation naturally leads to the following
question: Is there a specific time T = (M −1)τ at which
the measured bitstrings, subsequently used as reference
states, encode more meaningful information about the
system’s long-time dynamics? Addressing this question
would require systematic studies to determine whether
such a characteristic time exists and how it may depend
on the interplay between the system’s Hamiltonian norm,
the number of reference states, and the Trotterization
error.
Further investigations towards a better method
for reference state selection could provide valuable in-
sight into optimizing the sQKFF algorithm for enhanced
stability and efficiency in simulating long-time quantum
dynamics.
Finally, resource estimations for the quantum circuits
used to compute the elements of the S and H matrices
are summarized in Tab. II. These indicate that a sub-
stantial reduction in computational resources is achieved
through QWC aggregation. Moreover, the reduction ra-
tio γ remains nearly constant as the Trotter error thresh-
old εT increases. Since each step of the Trotterized time-
evolution operator involves the repeated application of
the same operator, the resource reduction per step is ex-
pected to be consistent with that of the overall circuit,
with minor variations arising only from cancellations of
adjacent adjoint operations between steps.
IV.
ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND
OUTLOOK
The framework presented in this work shows that sim-
ulating the dynamics of the quantum system over short
timescales can enable access to physically and opera-
tionally relevant regimes.
In particular, our numerical
results using a few picoseconds of quantum simulation
show excellent agreement with exact simulations up to
50-100 nanoseconds.
This proof of principle indicates
that, even under restrained resources and hardware noise,
quantum computers combined with optimized simulation
techniques can serve as effective platforms for studying
the properties and dynamics of spin-defects in solid-state
materials. Advancing toward practical implementation

on real quantum hardware will require addressing addi-
tional considerations, such as the number of measure-
ment shots, crucial for accurately estimating expecta-
tion values [67, 68], as well as the number of qubits and
their limited connectivity [69, 70]. The former is relevant
because the sQKFF algorithm relies on computing the
expectation value of the Hamiltonian, whereas the lat-
ter becomes particularly relevant when simulating quan-
tum systems with non-trivial interactions, such as the
dipole–dipole coupling present in Configurations 2 and
3, which introduces a large number of entangled pairs.
Further analysis of measurement cost will be essential
to assess the feasibility of sQKFF on real quantum hard-
ware. Krylov-subspace approaches are notoriously sen-
sitive to noise because the overlap matrix S is often ill-
conditioned, so practical implementations typically reg-
ularize by projecting onto the subspace associated with
eigenvalues above a chosen threshold [71, 72]. In sQKFF,
finite-shot Hadamard tests introduce statistical fluctua-
tions in the estimated elements of S and H, as well as
in the probability distributions used for reference-state
selection, and these fluctuations can be amplified by the
conditioning of S. Consequently, although each circuit
instance can be shallow, achieving additive precision ϵ
in the required matrix elements by direct sampling gen-
erally demands O(1/ϵ2) repetitions, so wall-clock time
can be dominated by shot count when executions are se-
rialized. Two complementary mitigations are available:
using recent advances to reduce shot overhead [73], in-
cluding new subspace methods that exploit symmetries
to reduce the number of distinct Hamiltonian terms that
must be measured, resulting in substantial shot savings
[74], and circuit repetitions can be parallelized between
multiple QPUs using distributed execution strategies by
shot [75, 76]. Alternatively, when coherent access to the
circuit (and its inverse) is available, one can replace clas-
sical sampling with amplitude-estimation variants of the
Hadamard test, which reduce the query complexity to
O(1/ϵ) at the cost of deeper, controlled circuits [77]. Be-
yond measurement overhead, our results indicate that
long-time accuracy is primarily limited by reference-state
choice: selecting states to maximize overlap with either
the initial state or a short-time evolved state is insuffi-
cient, motivating more dynamics-aware selection criteria
that can achieve reliable long-time evolution with fewer
Trotter steps and reduced quantum resources.
V.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this work, a framework for simulating and charac-
terizing spin-defects in solid-state materials is proposed,
aiming to support the research of current and new plat-
forms for quantum technologies.
The framework inte-
grates multiple resource-optimization strategies within
the PennyLane library, including Hamiltonian mapping
via Gray encoding, qubit-wise commuting aggregation,
and the multi-reference, selected Quantum Krylov Fast-
Forwarding algorithm. Three NV−configurations were
analyzed, incorporating interactions found in experimen-
tal setups. This hybrid approach enabled the evaluation
of autocorrelation functions, absorption spectra, and ℓ1-
norm of coherence at extended timescales, while provid-
ing detailed estimations of quantum resources under dif-
ferent Trotterization thresholds and numbers of reference
states.
High-precision autocorrelation functions were achieved
for Configurations 1 and 3; microwave absorption spectra
and ℓ1-norm of coherence were also computed for Con-
figuration 1. All these results reproduced QuTiP simu-
lations over tens of nanoseconds, even under moderate
Trotterization errors. Increasing the number of reference
states had the greatest impact on both accuracy and sim-
ulated time range, while qubit-wise commuting aggrega-
tion consistently reduced quantum resource requirements
by 18–30% across all configurations. These results high-
light the potential of the multi-reference, selected Quan-
tum Krylov Fast-Forwarding algorithm as a scalable tool
for simulating complex quantum dynamics on NISQ and
early fault-tolerant devices.
While quantum technologies provide promising and
theoretically advantageous approaches to addressing real-
world problems, the current hardware available in the
NISQ and early fault-tolerant eras remains constrained
by limited resources.
Our work demonstrates how in-
tegrating different techniques can harness the natural
suitability of digital quantum computers for simulat-
ing quantum systems, enabling reduced resource require-
ments and extended operational timescales in the design
and characterization of next-generation quantum tech-
nologies based on spin defects in solid-state materials.
The ability to simulate complex dynamics across con-
figurations that are classically intractable may prove cru-
cial for advancing quantum device engineering and over-
coming present technological limitations. Nevertheless,
this study also highlights the inherent challenges of sim-
ulating quantum systems with non-trivial interactions,
both operationally and methodologically. Although the
digital simulation of the time evolution of such systems
remains a long-term objective, it is a feasible and worth-
while pursuit that holds substantial promise for the con-
tinued development of quantum technologies.
KEY SOFTWARE PACKAGES
The framework was implemented using PennyLane
v0.42 and Catalyst v0.12 [78], with numerical results
compared against approximated solutions obtained with

ing the sesolve function with adams method for ODE
integration, absolute tolerance 10−5, and relative toler-
ance 10−6.

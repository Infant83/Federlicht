We develop a quantum-computer-aided framework for simulating such devices using a general electron spin resonance Hamiltonian incorporating zero-field splitting, the Zeeman effect, hyperfine interactions, dipole-dipole spin-spin terms, and electron-phonon decoherence. Within this model, we combine Gray-encoded qudit-to-qubit mappings, qubit-wise commuting aggregation, and a multi-reference selected quantum Krylov fast-forwarding (sQKFF) hybrid algorithm to access long-time dynamics while remaining compatible with NISQ and early fault-tolerant hardware constraints. Numerical simulations demonstrate the computation of autocorrelation functions up to $\\sim100$ ns, together with microwave absorption spectra and the $\\ell_1$-norm of coherence, achieving 18-30$\\%$ reductions in gate counts and circuit depth for Trotterized time-evolution circuits compared to unoptimized implementations. Using the nitrogen vacancy center in diamond as a testbed, we benchmark the framework against classical simulations and identify the reference-state selection in sQKFF as the primary factor governing accuracy at fixed hardware cost. This methodology provides a flexible blueprint for using quantum computers to design, compare, and optimize solid-state spin-qubit technologies under experimentally realistic conditions.", "primary_category": "quant-ph", "categories": ["quant-ph", "cond-mat.mtrl-sci"], "doi": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22091v1", "entry_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22091v1"}

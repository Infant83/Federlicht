Abstract
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown impressive capabilities across
a wide range of robotics manipulation tasks. However, their growing model
size poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained robotic
systems. While 1-bit pretraining has proven effective for enhancing the inference
efficiency of large language models with minimal performance loss, its application
to VLA models remains underexplored. In this work, we present BitVLA, the first
1-bit VLA model for robotics manipulation, in which every parameter is ternary,
i.e., {−1, 0, 1}. To further reduce the memory footprint of the vision encoder, we
propose the distillation-aware training strategy that compresses the full-precision
encoder to 1.58-bit weights. During this process, a full-precision encoder serves
as a teacher model to better align latent representations. Despite the lack of
large-scale robotics pretraining, BitVLA achieves performance comparable to the
state-of-the-art model OpenVLA-OFT with 4-bit post-training quantization on the
LIBERO benchmark, while consuming only 29.8% of the memory. These results
highlight BitVLA’s promise for deployment on memory-constrained edge devices.

Introduction
Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in vision-language models (VLMs) [HLG+24,
ZWC+25, WBT+24, BCL+25]. These models have achieved impressive results across a wide
range of downstream tasks, such as visual question answering [LLWL23, LLLL24], mathematical
reasoning [ZHY+25, WQH+25], and human-agent interaction [HWL+24, QYF+25]. Building
upon this progress, the field is increasingly moving toward vision-language-action (VLA) models,
which extend the modalities of VLMs to incorporate action generation for robotic control [BBC+23,
ZYX+23, DXS+23, MZH+23, KPK+24, LLZ+24]. These models aim to endow robots with the
ability to understand visual environments, follow natural language instructions, and perform tasks
autonomously. VLA models offer a unified framework to bridge perception, language understanding,
and motor control, making them a promising paradigm for embodied AI.
However, deploying such large-scale VLA models in real-world robotic systems remains highly
challenging, particularly on resource-constrained edge devices. These systems are often limited
in terms of memory, computational throughput, and energy availability. Recent efforts in model
quantization have shown that reducing the bit-width of model weights and activations can yield
substantial improvements in efficiency. In particular, 1-bit large language models (LLMs) [WMD+23,
MWM+24, MWH+25], where every parameter is restricted to ternary values (i.e., {−1, 0, 1}), have
emerged as a compelling solution. These models achieve competitive performance on a variety of
NLP benchmarks while dramatically reducing memory footprint, energy consumption, and inference
latency. Moreover, the ternary parameter space enables efficient hardware execution and can simplify

confined to the language domain. To the best of our knowledge, their extension to multimodal tasks
and robotic control has not yet been thoroughly explored.

ing a vision-language model using the
1-bit LLM in conjunction with a full-
precision vision encoder, following the
training paradigm of LLaVA [LLWL23].
To further reduce memory footprint, we
introduce distillation-aware training to
quantize the vision encoder to 1.58-bit
weights and 8-bit activations. During
this stage, we only train the vision en-
coder of the model, in which the full-
precision encoder is used as the teacher
model to better align the latent represen-
tations. Despite the absence of large-scale robotics pretraining, as shown in Figure 1, BitVLA
achieves performance on par with the state-of-the-art model OpenVLA-OFT [KFL25] with 4-bit
post-training quantization, while only using 29.8% memory footprint. These results demonstrate that
BitVLA offers a cost-effective and high-performance solution for robotics manipulation, making it
feasible for memory-constrained robotic systems.

Related Works
Vision-Language-Action models.
Inspired by the rapid progress of VLMs, researchers in robotics
have begun exploring VLA models that directly generate low-level control signals.
The RT
series [ZYX+23, ORM+] introduced Open X-Embodiment (OXE), a large-scale standardized
robotics dataset, and used it to train RT-X, a generalist model for robotic manipulation tasks.
OpenVLA [KPK+24] provided a detailed discussion on the design of VLA, covering aspects
from the pretraining architecture to parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods and deployment strate-
gies, while fully open-sourcing the training methods across all stages and the pre-trained model.
RoboFlamingo [LLZ+24] leveraged pre-trained VLMs for single-step vision-language reason-
ing, introduced a policy head to capture sequential history, and required minimal fine-tuning
via imitation learning. OpenVLA-OFT [KFL25] optimized the fine-tuning process by modeling
continuous actions, employing parallel decoding, and applying action chunking from imitation
learning [ZKLF23, CFD+23]. To improve inference efficiency, TinyVLA [WZL+24] adopts a
compact 1.3B VLM backbone and skips pretraining to enhance data efficiency. Most recently,
NORA [HSH+25] demonstrated competitive performance by utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-3B [BCL+25]
as its backbone, enhanced with the FAST+ tokenizer for action generation.
Native 1-bit models.
Modern deep learning research is increasingly focused on quantization-aware
training and low-precision inference [PWW+23, XLCZ23, LLH+23]. Recent studies [WMD+23,
MWM+24, KVM+24, ZZS+24, WMW24, WMW25] have demonstrated the potential of 1-bit and
1.58-bit pre-training for LLMs. [WMD+23] empirically showed that the performance gap be-
tween 1-bit and full-precision models narrows as the parameter count increases. Further, BitNet
b1.58 [MWM+24] showed that 1.58-bit LLMs can match the performance of full-precision models
starting from the 3B scale, while significantly reducing inference costs in terms of memory footprint,
decoding latency, and energy consumption. OneBit [XHY+24] further explored the use of knowl-
edge distillation for training binary LLMs. bitnet.cpp [WZS+25] developed an inference system
optimized for 1-bit LLMs, substantially lowering energy consumption and improving decoding
latency on CPU devices. More recently, [MWH+25] trained a 2B-parameter ternary LLM, achieving
competitive performance relative to leading open-weight LLMs. The low memory and energy require-

training to quantize the vision encoder’s weights to 1.58-bit precision. Finally, BitVLA is adapted to
specific robotics tasks through OFT fine-tuning [KFL25].
ments of 1-bit LLMs make them particularly attractive for edge applications, especially for robotics
tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, the extension of 1-bit models to vision-language and
vision-language-action training remains largely unexplored.

BitVLA: 1-bit VLA
In this section, we first introduce the model architecture of BitVLA in Section 3.1. Next, we detail
the objectives of the distillation-aware training strategy in Section 3.2, which aims to compress the
full-precision encoder weights to 1.58-bit. Finally, we describe the fine-tuning procedure of BitVLA
on downstream tasks in Section 3.3.
3.1
Model Architecture
BitVLA adopts BitNet b1.58 2B4T [MWH+25] as the LLM backbone and utilizes SigLIP-
L [ZMKB23] as the vision encoder. We employ the version of SigLIP-L pre-trained on 224 × 224
resolution images, resulting in shorter sequences of visual tokens. This choice enhances computa-
tional efficiency with minimal impact on performance [KPK+24]. We use a two-layer MLP with
GeLU activation functions as the connector, which remains in full-precision due to its negligible
contribution to the overall model size.
Figure 2 provides an overview of the training of BitVLA. Following the training strategy of
LLaVA [LLWL23], we begin by training the VLM using the 1-bit LLM and a full-precision vi-
sion encoder. In the first stage, only the connector is trained on a small image captioning dataset to
align the LLM with the vision encoder. This is followed by a visual instruction tuning phase, during
which the vision encoder is frozen while the remaining components are updated. Finally, we perform
distillation-aware tuning to quantize the vision encoder into a low-bit representation.
For quantization, we employ the absmean quantizer for weights and the per-token absmax quantizer
for activations [MWM+24]. The weights are quantized to ternary values (i.e., {−1, 0, 1}), while the
activations are quantized to symmetric INT8 (i.e., [−128, 127]). Specifically, the quantization can be
formulated as:
Qw(W) = α · RoundClip(W
α , −1, 1), α =
1
nm||W||1
(1)
Qa(x) =
β
127 · RoundClip(127x

RoundClip(x, a, b) = max(a, min(b, round(x)))

where W ∈Rm×n denotes the learnable weight of linear layer and x ∈Rn×1 denotes the inputs.
The output of a ternary linear layer is computed as Y = Qw(W)Qa(x), where Qw and Qa denote
the quantization functions for weights and activations, respectively.
We apply quantization to all linear layers in the vision encoder, excluding the input and output
embedding layers. BitVLA is trained with quantization-aware training, where quantization is per-
formed on-the-fly during the forward pass. Due to the non-differentiable nature of quantization
operations, we adopt the straight-through estimator (STE) [BLC13] to approximate gradients during
backpropagation. Specifically, the gradients are passed directly through the quantization functions,
following the approximation:
∂L
∂W =
∂L
∂Qw(W),
∂L
∂X =
∂L
∂Qa(X)
(4)
Both the gradients and optimizer states are maintained in full precision to preserve training stability.
3.2
Distillation-aware Training
In this subsection, we introduce the distillation-aware training to effectively quantize the vision
encoder of VLM to 1.58 bit-widths. We illustrate the overview in Figure 3. We first initialize the
latent weights of 1.58-bit encoder from its full-precision counterpart. Then we adopt the full-precision
encoder as the teacher model. The training objective Ltotal requires the minimization of both task-
specific loss LLM and an auxiliary alignment loss Laux of latent representations between full-precision
and 1.58-bit encoder.
Language modeling loss.
The auto-regressive language modeling loss, LLM, is widely used in
training VLMs. Let T denote the input text sequence, which is divided into an instruction part Tins
and a response part Tans. The visual tokens extracted by the 1.58-bit vision encoder are denoted as
V1.58-bit. The language modeling loss can be formulated as:
LLM = −
X
tokeni∈Tans
log Pr(Yi | V1.58-bit, T [:i−1])
4


===== PAGE 5 =====
where Yi represents the model’s predicted token at position i. The loss is computed only over the
response tokens Tans, while the instruction and visual tokens are provided as context.
Representations alignment loss.
To enhance the alignment between the latent representations of
the 1.58-bit and full-precision vision encoders, we learn the 1.58-bit encoder through knowledge
distillation, in which the full-precision encoder is used as the teacher model. Let hl
bf16 and hl
1.58-bit
denote the outputs of the l-th layer from the full-precision and 1.58-bit vision encoders, respectively.
The alignment loss is defined as:
Laux = 1
n
L
X
l=1
hl
bf16 −hl
1.58-bit
2
where n is the hidden dimension and L is the total number of layers in the vision encoder. This
auxiliary loss encourages the 1.58-bit vision encoder to mimic the representational behavior of its
full-precision counterpart.
Above all, the training objective Ltotal is:
Ltotal = LLM + γ · Laux
(5)
where γ is a coefficient for representations alignment. During the distillation-aware training, only
the vision encoder is trainable while the other components (i.e., LLM and connector) are frozen. In
our experiments, we observe that, unlike the 1.58-bit pre-training of LLMs, the quantization-aware
training of 1.58-bit encoder is highly data-efficient with distillation from a full-precision teacher
model. It preserves most of the performance of its full-precision counterpart using only billions of
training tokens.
3.3
Robotics Fine-tuning
In this subsection, we describe the fine-tuning procedure of BitVLA for specific robotics tasks.
Following OpenVLA-OFT [KFL25], we utilize parallel decoding and action chunking techniques to
enhance the throughput of VLA models. Specifically, we replace the conventional causal mask used
in LLMs with a bidirectional attention mask, enabling each forward pass to generate a coherent action
trajectory over multiple time steps. This approach significantly boosts real-time control efficiency
compared to autoregressive, token-by-token predictions. Additionally, we integrate an MLP-based
action head to project the latent representations of query tokens into continuous robotic action space.
The model is trained to minimize the L1 loss between predicted actions and ground-truth trajectories.

Experiments
4.1
Model Training
BitVLA is trained with a three-stage procedure. Following LLaVA [LLWL23], we first train the
connector to align the vision encoder with the LLM using the LLaVA 1.5-558k dataset [LLLL24].
In the second stage, we freeze the vision encoder and train both the LLM and the connector on
a 10-million-sample subset of MammoTH-VL [GZB+24], consisting of single-image samples. In
the final stage, we train the vision encoder from full-precision (W16A16) to 1.58-bit weights and
8-bit activations (W1.58A8) on a 5-million-sample subset from the data in the second stage. The
training data in Stage III contains up to 10B tokens. The distillation loss on latent representations is
weighted by a coefficient γ = 0.1. As recommended by [MWM+24], we use a large learning rate for
instruction tuning. The training requires 14 days on 8 NVIDIA A100 cards with 80GB memory. We
present the detailed hyperparameter configurations in Appendix A.

objects arranged in novel configurations), object generalization (adapting to previously unseen ob-
ject categories), goal generalization (interpreting diverse language instructions), and long-horizon
reasoning (performing multi-stage tasks involving varied objects, layouts, and objectives). These
capabilities are systematically evaluated through four corresponding task suites, namely LIBERO-
Spatial, LIBERO-Object, LIBERO-Goal, and LIBERO-Long. Each task suite contains 500 expert
demonstrations systematically distributed across 10 distinct manipulation tasks. Additional details
are included in Appendix B.
Implementation details.
We use the same training dataset1 as OpenVLA-OFT [KFL25] during
fine-tuning. We process synchronized multi-view visual inputs from both wrist-mounted and external
cameras, while encoding proprioceptive signals such as end-effector positions. The physical state
measurements are projected into a single token using an MLP-based projector, which is then appended
to the image tokens. For action chunking, we set chunk size to K = 8 following OpenVLA-OFT,
and execute full chunks before re-planning.
We perform full-parameter fine-tuning for faster convergence across all experiments. Specifically,
BitVLA is fine-tuned for 10k steps on LIBERO-Spatial, LIBERO-Object, and LIBERO-Goal, and
for 100k steps on LIBERO-Long. We adopt a cosine decay learning rate schedule with a batch size
of 64. The 10k-step fine-tuning process takes approximately 4 hours on 8 NVIDIA A100 cards with
80GB of memory. More details can be found in Appendix A.
Baselines.
We compare BitVLA with the baselines under supervised fine-tuning on the LIBERO
dataset, including OpenVLA-OFT [KFL25], OpenVLA [KPK+24], SpatialVLA [QSC+25], CoT-
VLA [ZLK+25], NORA-Long [HSH+25], and π0 [BBD+24]. Specifically, π0 employs the flow-
matching architecture built upon a pre-trained VLM. NORA is trained from a strong lightweight VLM
Qwen2.5-VL-3B [BCL+25] to improve the efficiency. We adopt its NORA-Long variant, which
generates five-step action sequences at a time. CoT-VLA introduces visual chain-of-thought reasoning
by predicting future frames autoregressively before action generation. SpatialVLA incorporates 3D
information and learns a generalist policy for manipulation. OpenVLA is a 7B open-source VLA
model trained on the OXE dataset, surpasses closed models like RT-2-X [ORM+] in numerous tasks.
OpenVLA-OFT is fine-tuned from OpenVLA using a series of techniques, e.g., parallel decoding
and continuous action modeling, to improve the speed and performance for specific task. Due to

resource constraints, BitVLA is not pre-trained on large-scale robotics datasets. Therefore, we also
report OpenVLA-OFT results fine-tuned directly from its base VLM [KNB+24] for reference.
Main results.
Table 1 summarizes the success rates of BitVLA and various baselines on the
LIBERO benchmark suites. As shown in the table, although BitVLA is not pre-trained on a large-
scale robotics dataset (e.g., Open X-Embodiment [ORM+]), it still surpasses strong baselines with 3
billion parameters, including π0 and NORA-Long. In particular, BitVLA outperforms π0 by 2.4% on
LIBERO-Long, highlighting its effectiveness in long-horizon reasoning tasks for robotic manipulation.
Moreover, BitVLA has a lightweight memory footprint of only 1.4GB, making it feasible to deploy
on a single consumer-grade GPU such as the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti Laptop (4GB).
Compared to the larger OpenVLA-OFT model, BitVLA achieves comparable performance on the
Spatial, Object, and Goal subsets of the LIBERO benchmark, but still falls short on LIBERO-Long.
We attribute this gap to OpenVLA-OFT’s fine-tuning from OpenVLA, which benefits from large-
scale robotics pre-training and thus excels at complex manipulation tasks. As shown in the table,
pre-training on a large-scale robotics dataset boosts OpenVLA-OFT’s success rate on LIBERO-Long
from 86.5% to 94.5%. Notably, when compared to the OpenVLA-OFT variant without robotics
pre-training, BitVLA achieves comparable performance on LIBERO-Long.
Comparison with post-training quantization.
We compare BitVLA with OpenVLA and
OpenVLA-OFT models subjected to 8-bit and 4-bit post-training quantization. We use their publicly
available fine-tuned checkpoints released on Hugging Face. For quantization, we employ the bit-
sandbytes toolkit [DLBZ22] to convert the model backbones to INT8 and INT4 precision. We report
both the memory footprint and performance of the quantized models on the LIBERO benchmark.
As shown in Table 2, OpenVLA exhibits a larger performance degradation under 4-bit quantization
compared to OpenVLA-OFT. Notably, BitVLA achieves performance comparable to 4-bit quantized
OpenVLA-OFT while using less than one-third of the memory.
4.3
Experiments on Visual Question Answering
We evaluate the zero-shot performance of BitVLA with both full-precision and 1.58-bit vision en-
coders on visual question answering (VQA) tasks. The evaluation suite includes MMMU [YNZ+24],
SeedBench [LWW+23], SeedBench-2-Plus [LGC+24], MMStar [CLD+24], and AI2D [KSK+16].
We adopt the publicly available LMM-Eval toolkit [ZLZ+24] to ensure fair and consistent com-
parisons. As shown in Table 3, BitVLA equipped with the 1.58-bit encoder achieves performance
comparable to its full-precision counterpart. Specifically, the 1.58-bit encoder results in only a 1.5%

average accuracy drop across the five benchmarks, while reducing its memory footprint from 0.8GB
to 0.1GB. These results demonstrate that distillation-aware training effectively preserves performance
on general VQA tasks while significantly lowering memory consumption during inference.

Ablation Studies
Representations alignment loss.
We perform ablation studies to assess the impact of the proposed
representation alignment loss during distillation-aware training. As shown in Table 4, incorporating
the alignment loss significantly boosts the zero-shot performance of BitVLA with the 1.58-bit vision
encoder, raising the average accuracy from 42.4% to 50.8% across five VQA benchmarks. On the
LIBERO benchmark suites, where models are fine-tuned for specific tasks, the performance gain is
smaller but still meaningful. As reported in Table 5, the alignment loss leads to a 2.4% increase on
LIBERO-Goal set.
Data size of distillation-aware training.
We compare the performance of BitVLA trained with 5B
and 10B tokens during the distillation-aware training (Stage III). As shown in Table 4, increasing
the training data during the quantization-aware training of the vision encoder improves overall
performance on general VQA tasks. Specifically, BitVLA trained with 10B tokens in Stage III
surpasses the 5B-token counterpart by 0.7% in average accuracy. Additionally, on the LIBERO
benchmark, the 10B-token model achieves a 1.2% gain in average accuracy after fine-tuning.

Qualitative Analysis
In this section, we carefully analyze the failure cases of BitVLA on LIBERO benchmark suites,
categorizing them into three types: spatial localization discrepancy, goal misunderstanding, and
trajectory planning failure.
• Spatial localization discrepancy refers to the failure caused by inaccuracies in pose
prediction during manipulation. Typically, such errors occur in four main scenarios: (1)
manipulating objects with unstable centers of gravity, such as wine bottles, where small
miscalculations lead to instability (2) selecting imprecise grasping poses, causing objects to
topple during approach or drop during transportation (3) phantom manipulation attempts in
the absence of physical objects (4) positioning errors when placing objects at target locations,
resulting in task failures. These issues may arise from either coarse spatial understanding
derived from visual encoder or over-reliance on proprioceptive signals relative to visual
information under certain operational conditions in BitVLA.
• Goal misunderstanding refers to failure arising from BitVLA’s incorrect interpretation or
following of the language instructions. A typical scenario of this error occurs when the robot

ment. Right: typical examples for (a) spatial localization discrepancy, (b) goal misunderstanding and

erroneously interacts with non-target objects during task execution, subsequently initiating
another task rollout associated with the contacted objects. We hypothesize that this primarily
arises from the dominance of visual and proprioceptive information during the model’s
reasoning process at the moment of goal switching. This misalignment is also mentioned in
OpenVLA-OFT [KFL25], which proposes OpenVLA-OFT+ augmented variant employing
a FiLM strategy to alleviate this issue.
• Trajectory Planning Failure refers to execution errors caused by collisions during motion
planning. A typical case involves the robotic arm colliding with the lower panel of an open
drawer during bowl placement, leading to bowl drops or the arm becoming jammed. These
failures highlight the need for BitVLA to better leverage prior knowledge for generating
more rational and collision-free trajectories. Moreover, the system should anticipate the
feasibility of subsequent sub-goals (e.g., placing a bowl) when executing earlier ones (e.g.,
opening a drawer) to avoid operational conflicts. For instance, partially opening the drawer
may reduce trajectory complexity and lower the risk of collision.
We illustrates the distribution and specific examples for each failure type in Figure 5. The most
frequent failure type across all task suites is spatial localization discrepancy. We found that the
success criteria of LIBERO are very strict, especially in placement tasks, where success is only
determined if the object is placed precisely in the center of the plate. However, in many failure cases
within the Long suite, objects were successfully placed on the plate but still failed because they
were not centered. Nevertheless, the large number of errors in this category indicates that dexterous
manipulation tasks remain the biggest bottleneck for BitVLA.

Conclusion
We present BitVLA, the first 1-bit vision-language-action model for robotics manipulation, where
every parameter is constrained to ternary values. BitVLA is initially trained using a 1-bit LLM and
a full-precision vision encoder. To further compress the vision encoder, we introduce a distillation-
aware training strategy that converts its weights to ternary values. In this stage, the full-precision
encoder serves as the teacher model to guide the alignment of latent representations. Experimental
results on the LIBERO benchmark show that BitVLA achieves performance on par with the state-of-
the-art OpenVLA-OFT model with 4-bit post-training quantization, while reducing memory usage by
up to 3.36×. These results highlight BitVLA as a cost-effective and efficient solution for robotics
applications on memory-constrained hardware.

Hyper-parameters
We present the hyperparameter configurations used for training BitVLA in Table 6. Following the
recommendations of [MWM+24], we employ a two-stage weight decay schedule during visual
instruction tuning. For fine-tuning on the LIBERO-Spatial, LIBERO-Object, and LIBERO-Goal
suites, we report the best results selected from learning rates in the set 5e-5, 1e-4, 3e-4. For LIBERO-
Long, all models are trained with a peak learning rate of 8e-5 for the vision encoder and 4e-4 for the
LLM.

Tasks in LIBERO
In this section, we present the detailed task compositions of each task suite in LIBERO. As shown in
Table 8, it demonstrates the distinct task configurations across the four task suites within the LIBERO
framework. Figure 6 illustrates the scene visualizations for a subset of tasks.

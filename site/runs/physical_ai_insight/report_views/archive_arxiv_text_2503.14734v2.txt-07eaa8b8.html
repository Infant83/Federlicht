GR00T N1: An Open Foundation Model for Generalist
Humanoid Robots

Abstract
General-purpose robots need a versatile body and an intelligent mind. Recent advancements in humanoid
robots have shown great promise as a hardware platform for building generalist autonomy in the human
world. A robot foundation model, trained on massive and diverse data sources, is essential for enabling
the robots to reason about novel situations, robustly handle real-world variability, and rapidly learn new
tasks. To this end, we introduce GR00T N1, an open foundation model for humanoid robots. GR00T
N1 is a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with a dual-system architecture. The vision-language
module (System 2) interprets the environment through vision and language instructions. The subsequent
diffusion transformer module (System 1) generates fluid motor actions in real time. Both modules are
tightly coupled and jointly trained end-to-end. We train GR00T N1 with a heterogeneous mixture of real-
robot trajectories, human videos, and synthetically generated datasets. We show that our generalist robot
model GR00T N1 outperforms the state-of-the-art imitation learning baselines on standard simulation
benchmarks across multiple robot embodiments. Furthermore, we deploy our model on the Fourier GR-1
humanoid robot for language-conditioned bimanual manipulation tasks, achieving strong performance
with high data efficiency.
1. Introduction
Creating autonomous robots to perform everyday tasks in the human world has long been a fascinating goal and,
at the same time, a significant technical undertaking. Recent progress in robotic hardware, artificial intelligence,
and accelerated computing has collectively paved the ground for developing general-purpose robot autonomy.
To march toward human-level physical intelligence, we advocate for a full-stack solution that integrates the
three key ingredients: hardware, models, and data. First and foremost, robots are embodied physical agents,
and their hardware determines their capability envelope. It makes humanoid robots a compelling form factor
to build robot intelligence due to their human-like physique and versatility. Second, the diversity and variability
of the real world demands that the robots operate on open-ended objectives and perform a wide range of tasks.
Achieving this requires a generalist robot model sufficiently expressive and capable of handling various tasks.
Third, real-world humanoid data are costly and time-consuming to acquire at scale. We need an effective data
strategy to train large-scale robotic models.
In recent years, foundation models have brought forth dramatic breakthroughs in understanding and generating
visual and text data. They demonstrate the effectiveness of training generalist models on web-scale data to
enable strong generalization and fast adaptation to downstream tasks. The successes of foundation models in
neighboring fields of AI have depicted a promising roadmap for building the “backbone” of intelligence for
generalist robots, endowing them with a set of core competencies and enabling them to rapidly learn and
adapt in the real world. However, unlike the digital realms of words and pixels, no Internet of humanoid robot
datasets exist for large-scale pre-training. The data available for any single humanoid hardware would be orders
of magnitude too small. Recent efforts in the robot learning community (Open X-Embodiment Collaboration
et al., 2024) have explored cross-embodied learning to enlarge the dataset by pooling training data from many
different robots. However, the great variability in robot embodiments, sensors, actuator degrees of freedom,

dataset needed for training a true generalist model.

Figure 1: Data Pyramid for Robot Foundation Model
Training. GR00T N1’s heterogeneous training corpora
can be represented as a pyramid: data quantity de-
creases, and embodiment-specificity increases, moving
from the bottom to the top.
We introduce GR00T N1, an open foundation model
for generalist humanoid robots. The GR00T N1
model is a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model,
which generates actions from image and language
instruction input. It has cross-embodiment support
from tabletop robot arms to dexterous humanoid
robots. It adopts a dual-system compositional ar-
chitecture, inspired by human cognitive process-
ing (Kahneman, 2011). The System 2 reasoning
module is a pre-trained Vision-Language Model
(VLM) that runs at 10Hz on an NVIDIA L40 GPU. It
processes the robot’s visual perception and language
instruction to interpret the environment and under-
stand the task goal. Subsequently, a Diffusion Trans-
former, trained with action flow-matching, serves
as the System 1 action module. It cross-attends to
the VLM output tokens and employs embodiment-
specific encoders and decoders to handle variable state and action dimensions for motion generation. It
generates closed-loop motor actions at a higher frequency (120Hz). Both the System 1 and System 2 modules
are implemented as Transformer-based neural networks, tightly coupled and jointly optimized during training
to facilitate coordination between reasoning and actuation.
To mitigate the “data island” problem mentioned earlier, we structure the VLA training corpora as a data
pyramid, illustrated in Fig. 1. Rather than treating the training datasets as a homogeneous pool, we organize
heterogeneous sources by scale: large quantities of web data and human videos lay the base of the pyramid;
synthetic data generated with physics simulations and/or augmented by off-the-shelf neural models form
the middle layer, and real-world data collected on the physical robot hardware complete the top. The lower
layers of the pyramid provide broad visual and behavioral priors, while the upper layers ensure grounding in
embodied, real-robot execution.
We develop an effective co-training strategy to learn across the entire data pyramid in both pre- and post-
training phases. To train our model with action-less data sources, such as human videos and neural-generated
videos, we learn a latent-action codebook (Ye et al., 2025) and also use a trained inverse dynamics model
(IDM) to infer pseudo-actions. These techniques enable us to annotate actions on action-less videos so we
can effectively treat them as additional robot embodiments for model training. By unifying all data sources
across the data pyramid, we construct a consistent dataset where the input consists of the robot state, visual
observations, and language instruction, and the output is the corresponding motor action. We pre-train our
model end-to-end across the three data layers, spanning (annotated) video datasets, synthetically generated
datasets, and real-robot trajectories — by sampling training batches across this heterogeneous data mixture.
With a unified model and single set of weights, GR00T N1 can generate diverse manipulation behaviors
using single-arm, bimanual, and humanoid embodiments. Evaluated on standard simulation benchmark
environments, GR00T N1 achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art imitation learning baselines.
We also demonstrate GR00T N1’s strong performance in real-world experiments with GR-1 humanoid robots.
Our GR00T-N1-2B model checkpoint, training data, and simulation benchmarks are publicly available here:
GitHub and HuggingFace Datasets.

Figure 2: GR00T N1 Model Overview. Our model is a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that adopts a
dual-system design. We convert the image observation and language instruction into a sequence of tokens to
be processed by the Vision-Language Model (VLM) backbone. The VLM outputs, together with robot state and
action encodings, are passed to the Diffusion Transformer module to generate motor actions.
2. GR00T N1 Foundation Model
GR00T N1 is a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for humanoid robots trained on diverse data sources.
The model contains a vision-language backbone that encodes language and image input and a DiT-based
flow-matching policy that outputs high-frequency actions. We use the NVIDIA Eagle-2 VLM (Li et al., 2025) as
the vision-language backbone. Specifically, our publicly released GR00T-N1-2B model has 2.2B parameters
in total, with 1.34B in the VLM. The inference time for sampling a chunk of 16 actions is 63.9ms on an L40
GPU using bf16. Fig. 2 provides a high-level overview of our model design. We highlight three key features of
GR00T N1:
• We design a compositional model that integrates Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based reasoning module
(System 2) and Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based action module (System 1) in a unified learning
framework;
• We develop an effective pre-training strategy using a mixture of human videos, simulation and neural-
generated data, and real robot demonstrations (see Fig. 1) for generalization and robustness;
• We train a massively multi-task, language-conditioned policy that supports a wide range of robot embodi-
ments and enables rapid adaptation to new tasks through data-efficient post-training.
2.1. Model Architecture
In this section, we describe the GR00T N1 model architecture, illustrated in Fig. 3. GR00T N1 uses flow-
matching (Lipman et al.) to learn action generation. A diffusion transformer (DiT) processes the robot’s
proprioceptive state and action, which are then cross-attended with image and text tokens from the Eagle-2
VLM backbone to output the denoised motor actions. Below, we elaborate on each module in detail.
State and Action Encoders
To process states and actions of varying dimensions across different robot embodiments, we use an MLP per
embodiment to project them to a shared embedding dimension as input to the DiT. As in Black et al. (2024),

Figure 3: GR00T N1 Model Architecture. GR00T N1 is trained on a diverse set of embodiments ranging from
single-arm robot arms to bimanual humanoid dexterous hands. To deal with different robot embodiment’s
state observation and action, we use DiT blocks with an embodiment-aware state and action encoder to embed
the robot’s state and action inputs. GR00T N1 model leverages latent embeddings of the Eagle-2 model to
incorporate the robot’s visual observation and language instructions. The vision language tokens will then be
fed into the DiT blocks through cross-attention layers.
the Action Encoder MLP also encodes the diffusion timestep together with the noised action vector.
We use action flow matching, which samples actions through iterative denoising. The model takes as input
noised actions in addition to encodings of the robot’s proprioceptive state, image tokens, and text tokens. The
actions are processed in chunks as in Zhao et al. (2023), meaning that at any given time 𝑡the model uses
𝐴𝑡= [𝑎𝑡, 𝑎𝑡+1, . . . , 𝑎𝑡+𝐻−1] which contains the action vectors of timesteps 𝑡through 𝑡+ 𝐻−1. We set 𝐻= 16
in our implementation.
Vision-Language Module (System 2)
For encoding vision and language inputs, GR00T N1 uses the Eagle-2 (Li et al., 2025) vision-language model
(VLM) pretrained on Internet-scale data. Eagle-2 is finetuned from a SmolLM2 (Allal et al., 2025) LLM and
a SigLIP-2 (Tschannen et al., 2025) image encoder. Images are encoded at resolution 224 × 224 followed by
pixel shuffle (Shi et al., 2016), resulting in 64 image token embeddings per frame. These embeddings are then
further encoded together with text by the LLM component of the Eagle-2 VLM. The LLM and image encoder
are aligned over a broad set of vision-language tasks following the general recipe of Li et al. (2025).
During policy training, a text description of the task, as well as (possibly multiple) images, are passed to the
VLM in the chat format used during vision-language training. We then extract vision-language features of
shape (batch size × sequence length × hidden dimension) from the LLM. We found that using middle-layer
instead of final-layer LLM embeddings resulted in both faster inference speed and higher downstream policy
success rate. For GR00T-N1-2B, we use the representations from the 12th layer.
Diffusion Transformer Module (System 1)
For modeling actions, GR00T N1 uses a variant of DiT (Peebles and Xie, 2023), which is a transformer with
denoising step conditioning via adaptive layer normalization, denoted as 𝑉𝜃. As shown in Fig. 3, 𝑉𝜃consists of

alternating cross-attention and self-attention blocks, similar to Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022) and VIMA (Jiang
et al., 2023). The self-attention blocks operate on noised action token embeddings 𝐴𝜏
𝑡together with state
embeddings 𝑞𝑡, while cross-attention blocks allow conditioning on the vision-language token embeddings 𝜑𝑡
output by VLM. After the final DiT block, we apply an embodiment-specific Action Decoder, another MLP, to
the final 𝐻tokens to predict the actions.
Given a ground-truth action chunk 𝐴𝑡, a flow-matching timestep 𝜏∈[0, 1] and sampled noise 𝜖∼𝒩(0, I),
the noised action chunk 𝐴𝜏
𝑡is computed as 𝐴𝜏
𝑡= 𝜏𝐴𝑡+ (1 −𝜏)𝜖. The model prediction 𝑉𝜃(𝜑𝑡, 𝐴𝜏
𝑡, 𝑞𝑡) aims to
approximate the denoising vector field 𝜖−𝐴𝑡by minimizing the following loss:
ℒfm(𝜃) = E𝜏
[︀
‖𝑉𝜃(𝜑𝑡, 𝐴𝜏
𝑡, 𝑞𝑡) −(𝜖−𝐴𝑡)‖2]︀
.
(1)
As in Black et al. (2024), we use 𝑝(𝜏) = Beta( 𝑠−𝜏
𝑠; 1.5, 1), 𝑠= 0.999. During inference, we generate action
chunks with 𝐾-step denoising. First, randomly sample 𝐴0
𝑡∼𝒩(0, I) and then use forward Euler integration to
iteratively generate the action chunk, updating as follows:
𝐴𝜏+1/𝐾
𝑡
= 𝐴𝜏
𝑡+ 1
𝐾𝑉𝜃(𝜑𝑡, 𝐴𝜏
𝑡, 𝑞𝑡).
In practice, we found 𝐾= 4 inference steps to work well across all embodiments.
2.2. Training Data Generation
To train GR00T N1, we use a diverse set of data sources and objectives to construct the data pyramid (Fig. 1).
We first source diverse human egocentric video data from open datasets, which forms the base, together with
the web data used in VLM pretraining. Next, we generate synthetic neural trajectories using pre-trained video
generation models. In this way, we ∼10× our in-house collected teleoperation trajectories — the “peak” of
the data pyramid — from 88 hours to 827 hours, using diverse counterfactual robot trajectories with novel
language instructions (see Fig. 5 for examples). We additionally generate diverse simulation trajectories, which
also expand the middle part of the data pyramid.
In the next paragraph, we first describe how we extract latent actions from videos, which we use to extract
labels for web-scaled human egocentric datasets. Next, we describe how we generate neural and simulated
robot trajectories, and how we obtain actions for each of these data sources.

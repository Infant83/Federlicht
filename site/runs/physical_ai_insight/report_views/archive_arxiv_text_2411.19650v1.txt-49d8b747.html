Abstract
The advancement of large Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models has significantly improved robotic manipulation in
terms of language-guided task execution and generalization
to unseen scenarios. While existing VLAs adapted from pre-
trained large Vision-Language-Models (VLM) have demon-
strated promising generalizability, their task performance
is still unsatisfactory as indicated by the low tasks success
rates in different environments. In this paper, we present
a new advanced VLA architecture derived from VLM. Un-
like previous works that directly repurpose VLM for ac-
tion prediction by simple action quantization, we propose
a componentized VLA architecture that has a specialized

action transformers for action sequence modeling, as well
as their favorable scaling behaviors. We also conduct com-

1. Introduction
In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in robotic
control models equipped with visual capabilities [7, 8, 15,
30, 34, 45, 48, 58, 60, 62, 67, 69]. Among them, the de-
velopment of large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models [8, 30, 32] are particularly promising, which em-
powers robots to perform complex tasks guided by natural
language instructions and potentially manage objects or en-
vironments that deviate from the training distribution. Ad-
ditionally, they exhibit rapid adaptability to new tasks and
embodiments through finetuning.
The notable generalization capability of large VLAs can
be attributed to both their substantial model size and the po-
tent Vision-Language-Models (VLM) [13, 28, 35] that serve
as their foundation. These VLMs are typically pretrained on
massive, Internet-scale image-text pairs, which play a cru-
cial role in enhancing VLA generalization to novel objects
and semantically diverse instructions [8].
Existing large VLAs often adapt VLMs for action pre-
diction in simple ways, leading to several issues that hin-
der task performance. For instance, works like [8, 30] di-
rectly quantize the continuous spectrum of robot actions
into discrete bins in accordance to the next token predic-
tion scheme of VLMs. However, such a simple quantiza-
tion, unlike sophisticated tokenizers such as those designed
for images [65, 72] and audio [19, 73], poses difficulties
in action learning and limits action precision. [32] intro-
duces additional action heads, such as LSTMs, to transform
VLM output into actions. The shift to a regression-based
learning scheme, however, overlooks the probabilistic and
multimodal1 nature of actions.
In this paper, we propose a new VLA model architec-
ture derived from VLM. Instead of repurposing pretrained
VLMs for action prediction, we use the cognitive informa-
tion extracted by VLM to guide the action prediction process
of a specialized action module. To handle the inherent char-
acteristics of action signals – continuous, multimodal, tem-
porally correlated, and requiring high precision – we em-
ploy advanced diffusion-based transformers (DiT) [51] as
our action modules, preconditioned on VLM output via the
attention mechanism.
The intuition behind our design is the decoupling of
“cognition” and “action” capabilities.
While the large
VLMs amass broad visual and semantic knowledge learned
from vast amounts of text and images, the cognitive capa-
bility and the output language modality have fundamental
gaps to dense robot actions. Rather than directly repurpos-
ing the VLMs, we advocate the design of componentized
VLAs with a dedicated action module.2 This action mod-
1A robot can follow multiple possible trajectories to accomplish a task.
2As an interesting analogy, our human brain has visual cortex [25],
language-relevant cortex [21], and motor cortex [71] – the last being dedi-
cated to the control of human body movements.
ule is specialized for action signal modeling with cognition
model output as preconditions. We synergize the cognition
and action capabilities via end-to-end training or finetuning.
Hence, our approach is named CogACT.
We systematically study the different backbone architec-
tures for the action module as well as their scalability on
model size, and several notable insights have emerged. For
example, it is found that sequential modeling with a dif-
fusion transformer significantly outperforms single-step ac-
tion prediction. More crucially, we identified a favorable
scaling behavior of the action module with diffusion trans-
formers: adding several hundred million parameters, which
is relatively minor compared to a 7B VLM base, results in
sizable performance enhancements. This finding suggests
the advantages of a specialized action module and a more
efficient approach for VLA model scaling.
In addition to our study on action module design, we also
introduce some accompanying algorithms of independent
interest. An Adaptive Action Ensemble (AAE) algorithm is
proposed to fuse the past action predictions in an adaptive
manner, which brings notable performance improvement.
We train our VLA models on the Open X-Embodiment
dataset [48], and evaluate them on both simulation [33]
and real-robot benchmarks. The comprehensive evaluation
and comparisons show that our model performs remarkably
well, surpassing existing VLAs by a wide margin.
The contributions of this work are summarized below:
• We introduce the integration of the action diffusion
process into large-scale VLA models.
• We propose a componentized VLA model architecture
and study the design of large action modules3 as well
as their scaling behaviors.
• We propose an adaptive action ensemble algorithm
which is simple yet effective for temporal fusion.
• Our model achieves significantly better performance
than previous VLAs, exhibiting quick adaptation to
new robots and tasks and effective generation to un-
seen objects and backgrounds, as shown in Figure 1.
All our code and models are publicly released.

Vision-Language-Action Models. The success of Large
Language Models (LLMs) [2, 9, 63, 64] and Vision-
Language Models (VLMs) [1, 14, 28, 37, 61] has inspired
the development of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) mod-
els, which extend the capabilities of VLMs by integrating
action generation.
For instance, RoboFlamingo [32] ex-
tends OpenFlamingo [3] by incorporating a head network
to predict actions and optimizing with MSE loss. RT-2 [8]
3Our largest action DiT module is of 300M parameters. Although this
may seem modest, especially in comparison with large LLMs/VLMs, it is
considered large given the 7D vector space of robot actions we address.

tokenizes 7D actions into discrete tokens and uses the VLM
PaLI-X [13] to predict them autoregressively like language
tokens. OpenVLA adopts a similar approach, tokenizing
actions and training the Prismatic VLM [28] on the Open-
X-Embodiment dataset [48]. While these models benefit
from VLMs’ capabilities and demonstrate promising per-
formance and impressive generalization, they lack the con-
sideration that actions are inherently continuous and tem-
poral, a modality distinct from language. A group of meth-
ods [5, 11, 68] employ large-scale video generative pretrain-
ing to enhance visual robot manipulation learning without
leveraging pretrained VLMs, and promising results have
been demonstrated.
Large Action Models. There are some recent attempts con-
current to ours that explored large action models for gener-
alist robots. For example, [24] trained a diffusion trans-
former with 221M parameters and [38] further scaled the
action model size to 1B. Both works apply separate vision
and language encoders that are pretrained and frozen to pro-
cess language instructions and images, and they train the ac-
tion model to integrate these inputs and predict actions with
VLA data. Different from ours, these works cannot lever-
age the generalization and instruction following capabil-
ity of powerful VLMs pretrained on Internet-scale vision-
language aligned data.
Diffusion-Based Robot Policies. Recent studies [15, 50,
53] have introduced diffusion models as an innovative ap-
proach for modeling robotic actions. These diffusion poli-
cies have demonstrated strong capabilities to capture the
multi-mode nature of robotic action distributions and effec-
tively model the various feasible trajectories that a robot can
take to accomplish a given task [15]. Inspired by diffusion
policies, Octo [62] supplements a transformer-based back-
bone architecture with compact diffusion heads of 3M pa-
rameters to adapt the action output across different robots.
However, the small diffusion head falls short in capturing
the precise action distributions and the overall approach
does not benefit from strong vision-language models pre-
trained on web-scale data.
In contrast, our work stud-
ies large, dedicated action modules (rather than “heads”)
with the diffusion transformer architecture. Besides, un-
like [15, 50, 53], we are interested in large VLAs derived
from VLM foundation models with strong generalization
capability.
3. Method
Problem Formulation.
Our goal is to develop a VLA
model that enables different robots to physically execute
diverse tasks while receiving visual observations and lan-
guage instructions. Formally, given the language instruction
l and visual observation ot at time t, a model π predicts a
temporal action sequence (at, at+1, ..., at+N) for execut-
ing the desired task:
π : (l, ot) →(at, at+1, ..., at+N).
(1)
While in general, at can describe various robot actions with
different control modes and end-effectors, we consider the
action space of a gripper with 7 degrees of freedom (DoF)
in this work:
at = [∆x, ∆y, ∆z, ∆ϕ, ∆θ, ∆ψ, g],
(2)
where ∆x, ∆y, ∆z are the relative translation offsets of the
end effector, ∆ϕ, ∆θ, ∆ψ denote the rotation changes, and
g ∈{0, 1} indicates the gripper’s open/close state.
Overall architecture.
To effectively handle complex vi-
sual observations and language instructions and collabora-
tively transform them into precise actions, we componen-
tize the model π into three parts: a vision module, a lan-
guage module, and an action module, as shown in Fig. 2.
We describe each part in details below.
3.1. Vision and Language Modules
Our vision and language modules are adapted from an ex-
isting VLM from [28] that has about 7B parameters in total,
similar to [30]. We briefly describe them below for com-
pleteness.
Vision Module.
The vision module processes raw images
input into a set of perceptual tokens. It consists of power-
ful vision transformers, DINOv2 [49] and SigLIP [74], pre-
trained on Internet-scale image data, to capture rich visual
features and a comprehensive semantic understanding of the
observations. At each timestep t, the image observation ot
is fed into the two models, producing two downsampled
feature maps f DINO
t
and f Sig
t
, respectively. These feature
maps are then concatenated along the channel dimension,
passed through a linear projection layer, and serialized into
a set of visual perceptual tokens, V = {v1, v2, ..., vNV}
with a length NV (we use 256 by default).
Language Module.
The language module is responsible
for integrating visual information and language instructions
and conducting cognitive reasoning.
Here, a LLAMA-
2 model [64] is applied as the backbone.
The language
instruction l is converted into a set of linguistic tokens,
T = {l1, l2, ..., lNT }, using LLAMA-2’s tokenizer. These
tokens are then concatenated with the visual tokens V and
an additional learnable cognition token c, and processed by
the model using a causal attention mechanism. The result-
ing output feature f c
t , corresponding to the cognition token,
encodes integrated information that determines the action to
be executed for the current task. This serves as a condition
for the subsequent action module to interpret and derive the
desired actions.

Figure 2. Overview of our architecture. Our model is componentized into three parts: 1) a vision module encoding information from the
current image observation into visual tokens; 2) a language module that integrates the visual tokens with the language instructions, and
produces a cognition feature determining the desired action to be executed; 3) a diffusion action module, which predicts a sequence of
multi-step actions conditioned on the cognition feature. An adaptive ensemble strategy is applied for trajectory ensemble at inference.
3.2. Diffusion Action Module
The action module receives the cognition feature as an in-
put condition to generate a series of actions, as defined in
Eq. (1) and (2). Given that real-world physical actions are
continuous and often multi-modal, we predict them using
a diffusion modeling process [47]. To model complex and
temporally-correlated actions, we apply a di</pre></main>

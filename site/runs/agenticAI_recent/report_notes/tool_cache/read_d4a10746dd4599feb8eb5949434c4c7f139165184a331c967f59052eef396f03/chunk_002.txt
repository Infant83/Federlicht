ibutes such as object appearance, style, or local
context. Most current MLLM-based retrieval methods (Liu
et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2024c; Lin et al., 2024a) compress
visual inputs into fixed embeddings or textual descriptions,
forcing the reasoning process to rely on language alone
to infer visual differences. Consequently, the model of-
ten produces speculative or hallucinated reasoning when
the required evidence lies in the visual modality. Even
recent reasoning-enhanced retrieval frameworks, such as
Retrv-R1 (Zhu et al., 2025d) and MM-R5 (Xu et al., 2025b),
improve textual reasoning depth but still rely on single-pass
visual encoding, lacking the ability to actively verify visual
hypotheses during reasoning.
To overcome this gap, we propose V-Retrver, an evidence-
driven retrieval framework that reformulates multimodal
retrieval as an agentic reasoning process grounded in vi-
sual inspection. Instead of treating visual representations as
static inputs, V-Retrver enables an MLLM to selectively ac-
quire visual evidence during reasoning by invoking external
visual tools. Through a multimodal interleaved Chain-of-
Thought process, the model alternates between hypothesis
generation and targeted visual verification, allowing it to
dynamically resolve visual ambiguities and progressively
refine ranking decisions, as illustrated in Fig. 1.

Candidate 2
<think>The objective is to identify a candidate that reflects 
specific visual transformations from the query: replacing a 
dark brown sofa with white pillows and books underneath with 
a white sofa and mottled pillows.Initially, we can perform a 
pre-screening to filter the candidates. Candidate 2 is an exact 
match for the negative example described in the text—a dark 
brown sofa with white pillows and books below—so it is the 
least relevant . . . Candidate 3 is a simple sofa lacking

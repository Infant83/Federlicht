 2025; Yin et al., 2025). This gap
motivates our study of language-guided viewpoint ground-
ing for multi-view spatial reasoning. We study perspective-
shift reasoning where the target viewpoint is specified in
natural language. Given multiple context images and a ques-
tion, the model needs to ground the description to a target
camera pose and answer from that perspective.
A recent line of work tackles perspective-shift reasoning by
augmenting MLLMs with generative world models that
actively synthesize additional observations at inference
time (Lee et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025c). While promising,
existing pipelines are often built around a single reference
view and do not effectively integrate multiple contextual im-
ages as a unified source of evidence (Lee et al., 2025; Yang
et al., 2025c). In addition, most controllable generators are
largely query-agnostic, which can produce imagined views
that are irrelevant or even inconsistent with the downstream
question (Yang et al., 2025c). Many of these methods rely
on expensive test-time procedures such as iterative search
or multiple candidate rollouts to obtain a useful imagined
view, resulting in high latency and limited practicality. Fi-
nally, off-the-shelf novel-view synthesis is typically pose-
conditioned, whereas MLLMs do not reliably infer target
camera poses from natural language description, leaving a
mismatch between language-driven viewpoint specification
and pose-controlled generation (Jin et al., 2024; Zhou et al.,
2025).

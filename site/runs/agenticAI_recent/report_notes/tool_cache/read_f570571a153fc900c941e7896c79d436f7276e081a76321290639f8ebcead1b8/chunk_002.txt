s where accurate intermediate visual states
are essential. On such tasks, purely textual CoT [19] can be an ill-posed interface: the model is
forced to describe intermediate visual evidence in language even when language is not a faithful
carrier, causing brittle reasoning and error accumulation [37]. To address this, recent works introduce
latent visual reasoning [11, 22] that supervises models to generate semantically grounded continuous

<reason>The rectangle has a width of 1 yard and a height of 2 
yards. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated using the formula:
Perimeter = 2 × (width + height) 
Substituting the values: 
Perimeter = 2 × (1 + 2) = 2 × 3 = 6 yards.
Thus, the perimeter is 6 yards.</reason>

Question: What is the 
perimeter of the rectangle?
1 yd
1 yd
2 yd
2 yd
Correct Answer: 6
The rectangle has:
- Two sides of length 1 yard
- Two sides of length 2 yards
The perimeter is the total distance 
around the shape.
Perimeter = 1 yd + 2 yd + 1 yd + 2 yd
Perimeter = (1 + 2 + 1 + 2) yd
Perimeter = 6 yd
The perimeter of the rectangle is 6 yards.

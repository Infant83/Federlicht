Abstract
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in
multimodal perception and reasoning by bridging vision and language. However, most existing
MLLMs perform reasoning primarily with textual CoT, which limits their effectiveness on
vision-intensive tasks. Recent approaches inject a fixed number of continuous hidden states as “visual
thoughts” into the reasoning process and improve visual performance, but often at the cost of degraded
text-based logical reasoning. We argue that the core limitation lies in a rigid, pre-defined reasoning
pattern that cannot adaptively choose the most suitable thinking modality for different user queries. We
introduce SwimBird, a reasoning-switchable MLLM that dynamically switches among three reasoning
modes conditioned on the input: (1) text-only reasoning, (2) vision-only reasoning (continuous hidden
states as visual thoughts), and (3) interleaved vision–text reasoning. To enable this capability, we
adopt a hybrid autoregressive formulation that unifies next-token prediction for textual thoughts with
next-embedding prediction for visual thoughts, and design a systematic reasoning-mode curation
strategy to construct SwimBird-SFT-92K, a diverse supervised fine-tuning dataset covering all three
reasoning patterns. By enabling flexible, query-adaptive mode selection, SwimBird preserves strong
textual logic while substantially improving performance on vision-dense tasks. Experiments across
diverse benchmarks covering textual reasoning and challenging visual understanding demonstrate
that SwimBird achieves state-of-the-art results and robust gains over prior fixed-pattern multimodal
reasoning methods.

Introduction
Building on the success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [32, 9] reasoning in LLMs, recent multimodal
research has adopted step-by-step reasoning to decompose complex vision-and-language problems
into intermediate steps that are easier to solve. With textual CoT, Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) [44, 7, 16, 24] have significantly improved on tasks requiring symbolic manipulation,
numerical calculation, and logical analysis.
However, this success does not fully transfer to vision-dense tasks where the bottleneck lies in dense
perception and spatial reasoning rather than logical structure [4]. Typical examples include maze
solving, fine-grained visual search, and other problems where accurate intermediate visual states
are essential. On such tasks, purely textual CoT [19] can be an ill-posed interface: the model is
forced to describe intermediate visual evidence in language even when language is not a faithful
carrier, causing brittle reasoning and error accumulation [37]. To address this, recent works introduce
latent visual reasoning [11, 22] that supervises models to generate semantically grounded continuous

<reason>The rectangle has a width of 1 yard and a height of 2 
yards. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated using the formula:
Perimeter = 2 × (width + height) 
Substituting the values: 
Perimeter = 2 × (1 + 2) = 2 × 3 = 6 yards.
Thus, the perimeter is 6 yards.</reason>

Question: What is the 
perimeter of the rectangle?
1 yd
1 yd
2 yd
2 yd
Correct Answer: 6
The rectangle has:
- Two sides of length 1 yard
- Two sides of length 2 yards
The perimeter is the total distance 
around the shape.
Perimeter = 1 yd + 2 yd + 1 yd + 2 yd
Perimeter = (1 + 2 + 1 + 2) yd
Perimeter = 6 yd
The perimeter of the rectangle is 6 yards.

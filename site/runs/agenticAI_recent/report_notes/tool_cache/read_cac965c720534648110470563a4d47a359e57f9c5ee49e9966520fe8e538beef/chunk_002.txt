ntelligent 
machines interact with humanity, but Asimov’s Laws represent perhaps the most 
enduring attempt to codify principles governing such interactions.2 Nevertheless, 
fictional guidelines, while elegant in their simplicity,3 fail to address the nuanced 
challenges of modern AI systems that operate through statistical patterns rather 
than deterministic rules.4
Thus, the AI alignment problem is essentially a problem of cross-cultural com-
munication between the world of human interpretation and the world of algorithmic 
optimization. I presume that this framing reveals a key dimension of usefulness of 
AI to human life – interpretability as more than a technical problem and sense-mak-
ing of real uses of AI. It represents a challenge of translation between two distinct 
forms of intelligence: human understanding built on cultural contexts, emotional 
resonance, and embodied experience vs machine learning systems operating through 
statistical pattern recognition across massive datasets. Interpretability challenges 
emerge from technical opacity as well as from fundamental differences in how 
humans and AI systems process information. While humans interpret through con-
textual understanding, cultural frameworks, and embodied experience, AI systems 
operate through statistical correlations that may lack causal understanding. This gap 
creates profound challenges for ensuring AI systems genuinely align with human 
intentions rather than merely optimizing for specified objectives that incompletely 
capture human values.5

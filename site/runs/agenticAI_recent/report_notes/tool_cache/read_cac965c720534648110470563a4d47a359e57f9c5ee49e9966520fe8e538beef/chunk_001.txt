Alignment Problem as Cultural and Legal Challenge: 
Artificial Intelligence, Interpretability, and Searching 
for Sense
Problem dostosowania jako wyzwanie kulturowe i prawne. Sztuczna 
inteligencja, interpretowalność i poszukiwanie sensu
ABSTRACT
The article examines the AI alignment problem as a fundamental challenge of cross-cultural 
communication between human interpretive frameworks and algorithmic optimization. The author 
argues that effective AI alignment requires integrating cultural sense-making practices and legal 
frameworks that vary across societies. The analysis reveals how current regulatory attempts, including 
the EU AI Act and national AI strategies, struggle with three interconnected challenges: ensuring the 
interpretability of algorithmic decisions, managing the indeterminism inherent in AI systems, and 
addressing knowledge extraction controversies. Through examination of emerging AI agents, Big 
Tech’s regulatory capture, and the rise of AI nationalism, the study demonstrates that alignment fail-
ures stem not from technical limitations alone, but from inadequate engagement with diverse cultural 
logics of interpretation. The author proposes frameworks that adapt AI systems to varied contexts 
while maintaining core functionality and concludes that solving alignment requires computational 
cultural modelling capable of navigating value pluralism. The analysis warns that without integrating 
technical safety mechanisms with cultural frameworks of societies, AI systems risk becoming tools 
of extraction and control rather than beneficial partners for societies.

The Zeroth Law of Robotics
A robot may not injure humanity, or,
through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.
I. Asimov, Robots and Empire (1985)
INTRODUCTION
In 1942, I. Asimov proposed the Three Laws of Robotics as a fictional foun-
dation for safe coexistence between humans and intelligent machines.1 Eight dec-
ades later, in an era of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems, we face far 
more complex challenge: ensuring AI systems operate according to human values 
and goals. Science fiction has long explored potential futures where intelligent 
machines interact with humanity, but Asimov’s Laws represent perhaps the most 
enduring attempt to codify pr

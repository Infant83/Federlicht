In this episode, Alex sits down with ZioSec’s Aaron Walls and Audrius Useckas to unpack the growing risks around agentic AI. As these systems evolve from simple prompts to autonomous agents capable of sending emails, unlocking doors, or accessing internal tools, their attack surface expands dramatically. With new protocols like MCP and A2A allowing agents to call APIs and communicate with each other, classic exploits like SQL injection are back in play — but with higher stakes. And just because an agent is internal doesn’t mean it’s safe; insider threats and privilege escalation are real concerns. The conversation marks a turning point: we’re no longer just talking about prompt safety — we’re facing real-world system vulnerabilities. Agentic AI brings incredible power, but without proper security, it could become a ticking timebomb.\n\nWatch the full episode here: \nhttps://youtu.be/rL9UCGVZEjs \n\nCheck out ZioSec: https://ziosec.com/ \n\nFollow Aaron: \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-walls/ \nX: https://x.com/aaron0walls \n\nFollow Andruis:\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/auseckas/ \n\nFollow Alex:\nX: https://x.com/alex\nLinkedIn: ⁠https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexwilhelm\n\nSubscribe to This Week in Startups for full episodes: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkkhmBWfS7pILYIk0izkc3A?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#startups #podcast #tech", "channel_title": "This Week in Startups Clips", "channel_id": "UCS7tJlcUA6PzVHEMo-X7ddg", "published_at": "2025-05-13T17:51:10Z", "duration": "PT5M16S", "tags": ["Jason Calacanis", "This Week in Startups", "Launch", "Angel Investing", "clips", "startups", "knowledge", "smart", "MBA", "investing", "diversification", "portfolio", "business", "tech", "silicon valley", "learn", "think", "short", "ai", "machine learning", "skills", "venture capital", "entrepreneur", "company", "founder", "start a company", "entrepreneurship", "capitalism"], "view_count": "1071", "like_count": "11", "comment_count": "1", "search_rank": 3, "source": "search", "summary": "With new protocols like MCP and A2A allowing agents to call APIs and communicate with each other, classic exploits like SQL injection are back in play — but with higher stakes.

Kees sees “pilot purgatory” driven by six recurring issues. Here’s the playbook—what goes wrong, and how to fix it.\n\n4/ Pilot purgatory (1–2): (1) Tech experiments without a business hypothesis/sponsor. (2) Sandbox or batch data; no secure, low-latency access to core systems, weak lineage/drift control, and inconsistent data quality.\n\n5/ Pilot purgatory (3–4): (3) Brittle POCs—no observability, rollbacks, retries, or bursting; ops can’t own them. (4) Compliance gaps—missing audit trails, content safety, explainability, PII protection, and human-in-the-loop approvals.\n\n6/ Pilot purgatory (5–6): (5) Bespoke one-offs—no “AI factory” for reuse, complexity/cost balloon. (6) People—users lack training, incentives, and trust; if they don’t trust outputs, they won’t use the system.\n\n7/ Trust requires more than transparency. Kees: you need guardrails, responsible use, and mechanisms that help users feel comfortable with outcomes—and understand how/why the system produced them.\n\n8/ 70% of challenges are people/processes. Example: a European org’s document-heavy work (legal/regulatory/policy). Early pilots nailed summarization and retrieval (e.g., PSD2/AML), but adoption stalled—no shared “AI-approved” definition, siloed governance, job fears.\n\n9/ The pivot: adopt an “AI factory” mindset with Azure AI Foundry as orchestration/governance; create a shared rhythm across risk/data/engineering; build reusable assistants; design for human-in-the-loop; add traceable citations, error flagging, and fix-feedback loops.\n\n10/ Bake compliance into workflows: every document/output logged for audit and lineage; AI champions drive peer-to-peer training. Result: trust up, adoption up, measurable productivity gains, and a scalable foundation for additional AI workflows.\n\n11/ Integration shock: pilots break when connected to ERP/core banking/CRM. Step 1—stabilize the data foundation: define systems of record, trusted data, lineage, ownership (e.g., consistent data products).\n\n12/ Step 2—standardize the connection model: move from point-to-point scripts to reusable connections and event-driven pipelines; expose a governed service/API layer. Step 3—scale with orchestration + observability in AI Foundry rather than “replacing legacy.”\n\n13/ Microsoft Agent Framework: unifies prior efforts (Semantic Kernel + O2Gen) into one framework to make the invisible visible—OpenTelemetry-based observability, end-to-end logging/evaluation, real-time monitoring of response quality, latency, lineage, content safety.\n\n14/ It adds resiliency (state management, retries, rollbacks, version control, pipelines) and governance by default (responsible AI policies, RBAC, content moderation, policy-as-code). It’s built natively into Azure AI Foundry.\n\n15/ Scaling Copilot: move from hub-and-spoke to an “AI factory mesh.” A central hub sets guardrails (governance, security, evaluation); domain teams build their own copilots/AI systems under the same policies—unlocking innovation with control.\n\n16/ What successful scalers share: clarity of purpose, confidence via transparency/user control, and community—AI champions/guilds to spread change.

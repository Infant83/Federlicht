Abstract
This study explores the nature of news
media coverage regarding artificial
intelligence (A.I.) and its effects on
audience members’ opinions about this
technology. A small-scale content
analysis of three major newspapers and
one cable news network revealed that the
“social progress” and “Pandora’s box/

Frankenstein’s monster/runaway science”
frames were the two most common ones
in A.I. coverage., and that the majority of
stories and segments portrayed this
technology in a positive manner. To
explore how exposure to such frames
impacts audience perceptions of A.I., an
experiment was conducted among
students at a Mid-Atlantic university. The
results demonstrate that exposure to an
article including both a social progress
frame and a Pandora’s box frame
resulted in stronger positive emotions.
Neither frame produced any other
discernible effects on emotional
responses to, perceptions of, or opinions
about A.I. Thus, the findings suggest that
framing this technology in a positive
manner while also addressing popular
concerns may be a particularly effective
strategy for promoting positive feelings
about it, if not for shaping other aspects

of public opinion. Results from the
content analysis and experimental
participants’ open-ended answers also
suggest that images of threatening
computers and killer robots in
entertainment media resonate with
audience members and provide a
foundation for their understanding of A.I.

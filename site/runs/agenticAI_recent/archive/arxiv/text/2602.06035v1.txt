Figure 1. InterPrior is a versatile generative controller instantiated as a goal-conditioned policy that controls a simulated humanoid to
follow goal guidance and interact with objects in a physics-based simulator. Three core, composable capabilities enable pursuing (I) long-
horizon snapshot goals, (II) trajectory goals, and (III) contact goals (Top). Yellow, blue, and red dots respectively denote human, object,
and contact goals. It demonstrates failure recovery (Bottom Left) from unsuccessful grasps. InterPrior enables steering control from a

Abstract
Humans rarely plan whole-body interactions with objects
at the level of explicit whole-body movements. High-level
intentions, such as affordance, define the goal, while co-
ordinated balance, contact, and manipulation can emerge
naturally from underlying physical and motor priors. Scal-
ing such priors is key to enabling humanoids to compose
and generalize loco-manipulation skills across diverse con-
texts while maintaining physically coherent whole-body co-
ordination. To this end, we introduce InterPrior, a scal-
able framework that learns a unified generative controller
through large-scale imitation pretraining and post-training
by reinforcement learning. InterPrior first distills a full-
reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned
variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal
observations and high-level intent. While the distilled pol-
icy reconstructs training behaviors, it does not generalize
reliably due to the vast configuration space of large-scale
human-object interactions. To address this, we apply data
augmentation with physical perturbations, and then per-
form reinforcement learning finetuning to improve compe-
tence on unseen goals and initializations. Together, these
steps consolidate the reconstructed latent skills into a valid
manifold, yielding a motion prior that generalizes beyond
the training data, e.g., it can incorporate new behaviors
such as interactions with unseen objects. We further demon-
strate its effectiveness for user-interactive control and its
potential for real robot deployment.
1. Introduction
Human-object interaction (HOI) is inherently hierarchical:
humans plan at a high level with sparse intentions, while
detailed limb coordination, balance, and contact emerge
through fast, intuitive motor responses [61]. For instance,
when reaching for a bottle, we plan the hand’s target and
object motion, while the rest of the body follows through
subconscious coordination. Motion imitation policies [87]

have scaled to large HOI skills but rely on explicit plan-
ners for dense full-body and object references. In contrast,
an interaction motor prior should sample feasible loco-
manipulation behaviors from a distribution conditioned on
sparse goals, e.g., next-second hand contact, rather than
simply mimicking deterministic, fully specified trajectories.
To model a distribution over feasible loco-manipulation
behaviors, early work [15, 44] learns a generative controller
via adversarial distributional matching and then uses rein-
forcement learning (RL) to promote task achievement un-
der it. These methods can expand motion coverage beyond
demonstrations, but are hard to scale due to unstable op-
timization, discriminator mode collapse, and handcrafted
task objectives. An alternative is to distill reference imi-
tation policies [37], with goal conditioning [59] achieved
without task-specific design. While these approaches can
absorb large-scale data, they can be brittle when reference
coverage lags far behind the configuration space—as in
loco-manipulation, where even a few object degrees of free-
dom can induce a combinatorial explosion of contact modes
and relative poses with different geometries.
To address these limitations, we introduce InterPrior,
a physics-based HOI controller that is scalable along four
axes (Figure 1). (I) task coverage: a single policy sup-
ports multiple goal formulations, e.g., sparse targets and
their compositions; (II) skill coverage: the same training
recipe scales to large HOI data and enables affordance-rich
interactions beyond simple grasping; (III) motion coverage:
it generates expressive trajectories instead of merely recon-
structing demonstrations; and (IV) dynamics coverage: it
maintains task success under varied physical properties.
Our key insight is that RL finetuning is essential for turn-
ing distillation from data reconstruction into a robust, gen-
eralizable policy. Distillation alone cannot cover the full
HOI configuration space, yet RL applied in isolation of-
ten drifts toward unnatural reward-hacking behaviors. We
therefore use distillation to provide a strong, natural initial-
ization, and apply RL as a local optimizer that improves ro-
bustness while remaining anchored to the pretrained model.
Concretely, we leverage distillation to inherit broad skills
from large-scale HOI demonstrations, by training a masked
conditional variational policy to reconstruct motor control
from sparse, multimodal goals, distilled from a reference
imitation expert. We then RL finetune this policy to con-
solidate its latent skills into a valid interaction manifold.
The finetuning optimizes two objectives: improving suc-
cess on unseen goals and initializations, and preserving pre-
trained knowledge through regularization. It leverages the
pretrained base policy to synthesize natural in-between mo-
tions, with failure states to acquire recovery behaviors, e.g.
re-approach and re-grasp. Together, these steps transform
reconstructed latent skills into a stable, continuous mani-
fold that generalizes beyond the training trajectories.
Our contributions are fourfold.
(I) We present Inter-
Prior, a generalizable generative controller for physics-
based human-object interaction,
encompassing diverse
skills rather than fixed procedural routines (e.g., approach,
grasp, place) typical of prior work.
(II) We develop an
RL finetuning strategy that enables robust failure recovery
and goal execution across varied configurations while main-
taining human-like coordination. The resulting controller
supports mid-trajectory command switching, re-grasps af-
ter failures, and remains stable under perturbations. (III)
We show that our finetuning strategy naturally extends to
novel objects and interactions, functioning as a reusable
prior. (IV) We demonstrate embodiment flexibility by train-
ing on the G1 humanoid [64] with sim-to-sim evaluation
and enabling real-time control via keyboard interfaces.
2. Related Work
Data-driven human interaction animation has progressed
from kinematic models assuming simplified object dynam-
ics [66, 99, 103] to methods generating whole-body motions
with dynamic objects [5, 8, 13, 14, 16, 19, 21, 22, 25, 33,
45, 49, 50, 74, 76, 83, 84, 88, 92, 97]. However, these kine-
matic approaches often exhibit implausible contact drift and
interpenetration. Such limitations partly arise from existing
HOI datasets [3, 18, 20, 26, 28, 31, 34, 40, 78, 81, 95, 96,
98, 102], which contain spatial or physical inconsistencies
that impede the learning of realistic interactions. Physics-
based methods seek to address this gap but often rely on
early curated datasets [56] focusing on limited yet high-
fidelity hand-centric manipulations [37, 59, 71].
Recent
advances in humanoid hardware [2, 10, 24, 55, 104] have
begun to bridge the virtual and physical domains, though
typically without too much agility. Together, these develop-
ments highlight the need for scalable HOI priors, models
capable of generalizing across tasks, remaining robust to
imperfect data, and synthesizing physically realistic HOIs.
2.1. Physics-based Character Animation
Physics-based character animation learns simulated con-
trollers via RL, e.g., tracking reference motions [46, 101].
Scalability has been improved through multi-clip trackers
with reference planners [23, 69, 72] without or with closed-
loop schemes [60, 82]. Nevertheless, such controllers re-
main constrained by their reference motion planners, mak-
ing them fragile when the planned motions are dynamically
unstable, a very common issue in HOI, where kinematic
planners often neglect physical feasibility. Learned gener-
ative priors address this limitation by encoding physically
plausible motor memory encoded into policies. One line
of research employs adversarial imitation with discrimina-
tors [47] to learn the motor prior, and later extends to skill
embeddings [48] and conditional control [9, 57].
These
approaches promote motion diversity but remain sample-
2


===== PAGE 3 =====
inefficient and challenging to scale. A complementary line
distills motor skills into compact latent codes. Earlier work
adopts model learning to train a variational autoencoder
(VAE) [27] based controller [11, 73, 89, 90], while recent
studies pretrain universal trackers [35] and distill them into
latent priors [36], masked policies [58], or offline training
with diffusion models [17, 63, 75]. Yet, these methods are
often limited by the expert converage. Our InterPrior syn-
ergizes the strength of both lines: it first distills large-scale
motion imitators and finetunes it via RL, bridging a genera-
tive controller with versatile conditions while enhancing the
control by alleviating out-of-distribution brittleness.
2.2. Physics-based Human-Object Interaction
Advances in physics-based character control have progres-
sively expandeded the scope of HOI animation. Early ap-
proaches primarily focus on simple object dynamics, such
as striking or sitting [4, 6, 43, 48, 77], whereas recent devel-
opments have extended to complex, scenario-specific sports
and games [1, 30, 38, 67, 68, 71, 79, 93]. Progress has also
been observed in generalizable tasks, such as object carry-
ing and rearrangement [7, 12, 15, 29, 42, 44, 54, 70, 94,
100], predominantly enabled by adversarial imitation learn-
ing, while most systems remain skill-specific, relying on
fixed procedural routines (e.g. approach, grasp, place with
regular-shaped objects). They struggle to adapt to objects
that require careful affordances and fine-grained interaction
skills (e.g., grasping a chair bar with one hand). To address
these limitations, HOI motion imitation [76, 80, 87, 91] has
emerged as a promising paradigm for scaling skill reper-
toires and capturing fine-grained interactions, as it directly
emphasizes precision and stability. Distilling such imitation
policies therefore represents a crucial step toward establish-
ing a versatile HOI controller. However, existing efforts of-
ten exhibit narrow task coverage, emphasizing single-object
proficiency [91] or relying on curated dataset with low-
dynamic and hand-centric skills [37, 39, 59]. Our InterPrior
provides a principled solution for generalizing a generative
controller for agile whole-body loco-manipulation.
3. Methodology
Task Formulation. We aim to learn a policy \pi that oper-
ates in a physics simulator and produces human-object in-
teraction motion from high-level goals rather than full ref-
erence. Such goals can be extracted from a human user
(e.g., steering control), a HOI kinematic motion generator
(see Sec. F), or keypoints from Motion Captured (MoCap)
data. The policy \pi conditions on the current human-object
state and recent history together with these goals, and sam-
ples control signals from its learned distribution to drive the
simulated human or humanoid to interact with the object.
The outcome is a rollout motion sequence that is physically
simulated, follows the provided goals where available, and

remains diverse and natural in aspects that are not specified.
Overview. Figure 2 illustrates our three-stage paradigm.
First, we train an expert policy \pi _E for large-scale HOI mo-
tion imitation, incorporating data augmentation, physical
perturbations, and shaped rewards to promote stable whole-
body coordination and precise grasping across diverse con-
figurations (Sec. 3.2). Second, we distill the expert into a
masked conditional variational policy \pi that maps sparse
goal inputs to a multi-modal distribution (Sec. 3.3). Third,
we finetune this policy \pi using RL to enhance robustness
under unseen configurations, employing failure-state resets
to encourage recovery behaviors (Sec. 3.4).
Each stage
is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which
shares a consistent input formulation comprising observa-
tions and goal conditioning, as well as an output action cor-
responding to low-level actuation commands (Sec. 3.1).

Here, the su-
perscripts h and o denote human and object quantities, re-
spectively. \protect \boldsymbol  {r} and \protect \boldsymbol  {\theta } denote positions and orientations, re-

locities.
The interaction terms include signed distances
from body segments to object surfaces \protect \boldsymbol  {D}_t and binary con-
tacts \protect \boldsymbol  {C}_t derived from simulator contact forces, follow-
ing [87].
All continuous quantities are normalized in a
human root-centric and local heading frame for invariance
to global placement. The human-related terms contain 52
components for the SMPL humanoid [35] and 39 for the
3


===== PAGE 4 =====
Unitree G1 robot [64]. Each rigid body contributes one el-
ement to human-related variables in \protect \boldsymbol  {x}_t, including \protect \boldsymbol  {D}_t and
\protect \boldsymbol  {C}_t, e.g., \p r otect \boldsymbol  {D}_t \in \mathbb {R}^{39 \times 3} for G1. Objects are all rigid.
Goal Conditioning. The policy is also conditioned on a
set of future goals that specify desired human-object con-
figurations at different horizons. During training, we ex-
tract goals from reference, where each reference yt shares
the same state space as observation xt, including human,
object, and contact components. A corresponding binary
mask mt indicates which components of the reference are
provided to the policy [58].
To capture both near-term
and distant intentions, we employ two types of goal con-
ditioning: (I) a short-horizon preview sequence and (II) a
long-horizon snapshot. Let H denote the maximum pre-
diction horizon, K ⊂{1, . . . , H} a set of short-horizon
offsets, and L a long-horizon offset. The long-horizon off-
set L is initialized randomly, decremented by one at each
timestep, and re-sampled when it reaches zero. For each
k ∈K ∪{L}, we retrieve (yt+k, mt+k), where the mask
mt+k is sampled to cover every possible condition e.g.,
end-effector pose, object pose, human-object contacts, their
combination, etc. (see Sec. C for details of the sampling).
Each goal is represented using a masked residual encoding:
 \til d e {\ b o
l
dsymb ol
 
{ y} } _ {t+k} =  \bol d s y
m b ol {m}_{t+k} \odot \Delta \!\big (\boldsymbol {y}_{t+k}, \boldsymbol {x}_t\big ), \\mathcal {G}_t = \{\,(\tilde {\boldsymbol {y}}_{t+k}, \boldsymbol {m}_{t+k}) \;|\; k \in K \cup \{L\}\,\}, where ⊙denotes elementwise masking and ∆
applies a log-map to rotational components and subtraction
to Euclidean quantities. During inference, user-specified or
model generated sparse targets can be supplied by filling
only the informed components, setting the corresponding
mask to one, and zeroing the rest.
Action. The policy outputs an action vector \protect \boldsymbol  {a}_t, defining the
actuation as \p r otect \boldsymbol  {a}_t \in \mathbb {R}^{51\times 3} for SMPL [32, 51] and \p r otect \boldsymbol  {a}_t \in \mathbb {R}^{29}
for the G1 humanoid [64]. Each action represents a joint
position target expressed in the exponential map, which is
subsequently converted into joint torques via proportional-
derivative (PD) control. The resulting torques are applied
to the corresponding joints in the physics simulator, driving
the human-object interactions and generating the next state
\protect \boldsymbol  {x}_{t+1} according to the simulator’s dynamics.
3.2. InterMimic+: Full-Reference Imitation Expert
Serving as the teacher for the final policy \pi , we formu-
late large-scale co-tracking of human and object motions
following InterMimic [87].
At each timestep t, the ex-
pert policy \pi _E receives the observation along with fu-
ture references, which contain complete information with-
out masking. The policy outputs low-level actuation com-
mands \protect \boldsymbol  {a}_t and is trained using Proximal Policy Optimiza-
tion (PPO) [53] to maximize a composite reward function:
 r  = r_{\text {track}} \times r_{\text {energy}}, where r_{\text {track}} promotes alignment between
the reference \protect \boldsymbol  {y}_t and simulation state \protect \boldsymbol  {x}_t, and r_{\text {energy}} encour-
ages physically plausible and efficient behaviors. This for-
mulation enforces strict adherence to the reference.
The policy from the original InterMimic achieves high-
fidelity imitation and broad loco-manipulation coverage.
However, in practice, we observe key issues due to the pol-
icy’s strong reliance on references, which we address with
our advanced version. (I) The policy shows a degradation of
precision when interacting with thin or small objects, as it
tends to rigidly follow reference trajectories (See Figure 3)
without utilizing fine-grained hand-object relations.
(II)
This limitation is more severe if the rollout deviates from
reference trajectories. To mitigate these issues, we expand
reference scope and introduce reference-free rewards.
Expanding Reference Scope. To reduce reliance on ref-
erence trajectories, we apply randomization, perturbation,
and augmentation. We initialize each episode from refer-
ence frames with random variations in human-object poses.
During rollouts, we apply sparse impulses, i.e., random ve-
locity perturbations to the pelvis and object, to induce devi-
ations from the references. We augment object shapes and
randomize physical properties such as mass density, center-
of-mass offsets, inertia, and friction, with details presented
in Sec. E. This exposes the policy to diverse dynamics, with-
out alternating the reference. Unlike common sim-to-real
practices, we do not randomize actuation parameters or add
observation noise, as these do not directly enhance state or
dynamics coverage. However, perturbations alone are in-
sufficient; it is necessary to introduce a termination penalty
that discourages the policy from entering failure under per-
turbation. We define r_{\ m athrm  {ter}} = -w_{\mathrm {ter}} \times c_{\mathrm {ter}}, where c_{\mathrm {ter}} is
triggered by a human fall or large deviations in states from
references, following [87], and w_{\mathrm {ter}} is a scaling coefficient.
Reference-Free Reward. A key challenge in precise hand
grasping under randomization and perturbation is that strict
reference-based tracking becomes unreliable. To address
this, we introduce a hand reward r_{\mathrm {h}} that encourages the
hand to target and wrap around the object based on the
current simulation state, rather than relying on reference
trajectories.
Details of the formulation can be found in
Sec. D. When combined with the reference imitation re-
ward, it serves as a corrective term that guides the hand to
orient, align, and close around the actual object, potentially
deviated from the reference due to perturbations, rather than
strictly following the reference trajectory. The full reward
is defined as r_ t  = (r_{ \ mathrm { tra c k}} \times r_{\mathrm {energy}} \times r_{\mathrm {h}}) + r_{\mathrm {ter}}.
3.3. InterPrior: Variational Distillation
Given an imitation expert policy \pi _E (Sec. 3.2) trained to
master motor skills for HOI, our objective is to distill it into
a variational policy \pi . Unlike the expert policy \pi _E, which
operates under densely supervised and fully observed ref-
erence trajectories, the variational policy \pi must preserve
naturalness and diversity with sparse cues. This is achieved
by sampling from a latent skill distribution, which endows
\pi with the capacity to generate plausible variations in action

space. Our framework builds upon [58, 85] with two new
designs: (I) multi-modal conditioning, including contact for
versatile human-object conditioning, and (II) prior shaping
and bounding regularization for robustness.
Model. We model the policy π with a latent zt ∈Rdz to
for multi-modality. As shown in Fig. 2, π consists of:
  \beg
in {a l igned} &\te
xtbf {Pr
ior:}  && p_\ psi (\b oldsym
bol {z}_
t \mi d  \bolds ymbol {x}_{t-\ell :t},\mathcal {G}_t),\\ &\textbf {Encoder:} && q_\phi (\boldsymbol {z}_t \mid \boldsymbol {x}_t,\mathcal {G}_t,\boldsymbol {y}_{t:t+H}, \boldsymbol {y}_{t+L}),\\ &\textbf {Decoder:} && f_\theta (\boldsymbol {a}_t \mid \boldsymbol {x}_{t-\ell :t},\boldsymbol {z}_t). \end {aligned} 
The encoder is an MLP used only during training; given the
full future reference, it outputs a Gaussian N(µq, Σq). In
parallel, a prior Transformer encodes recent history, with
history length ℓ, and a sparse goal, producing a Gaussian
N(µp, Σp). Following [58], we form a residual posterior
\pro t ect  \mathcal  {N}(\boldsymbol {\mu }_p + \boldsymbol {\mu }_q, \boldsymbol {\Sigma }_q). During training we sample the latent
skill via reparameterization:  \ b old symbol {z
}
_t  =
 (\b oldsymbol {\mu }_p + \boldsymbol {\mu }_q) + \boldsymbol {\Sigma }_q^{1/2}\boldsymbol {\epsilon }, \ \boldsymbol {\epsilon } \sim \mathcal {N}(\mathbf {0}, \mathbf {I}), and hold ϵ fixed within an episode to promote tem-
porally consistency [89]. During inference, only the prior is
used to sample zt ∼N(µp, Σp). The decoder MLP maps
the latent and observation to the action. The decoder also
includes an auxiliary head during training that reconstructs
the masked entries of the goal, encouraging a meaningful
latent space by learning to complete intent from context.
Bounding the Latent. To improve robustness and prevent
unnatural behaviors induced by out-of-distribution latents,
after sampling we project  \ b oldsymbol {z}_t \leftarrow \boldsymbol {z}_t / \|\boldsymbol {z}_t\| so that the policy
operates on a hypersphere, following [48]. This simple nor-
malization stabilizes skill learning by limiting the rare la-
tent draws while preserving directional variability for multi-
modal behaviors. Note that we apply the projection after
sampling, thus KL regularization can still be computed on
the Gaussian pψ and qϕ before projection.
Online Distillation and Regularization. We utilize an on-
line distillation framework following DAgger [52], where
the student policy π learns from a mixture of expert πE
and self-generated rollouts.
Training begins with trajec-
tories fully controlled by the expert πE, and the ratio of
student-driven states is gradually increased as learning pro-
gresses. At each step, the expert provides its action output
as supervision for the student. The policy is optimized us-
ing a composite objective consisting of multiple loss terms:
 \math c al {L } _{\tex t {tot a l}}  = \mathcal {L}_{\text {ELBO}} + \lambda _{\text {scale}}\,\mathcal {L}_{\text {scale}} + \lambda _{\text {tc}}\,\mathcal {L}_{\text {tc}}. The primary ob-
jective, LELBO, is a weighted evidence lower bound [27]
that combines three components: (I) an imitation loss en-
couraging the student to reproduce expert actions, (II) a
goal reconstruction loss promoting accurate completion of
masked goal entries to align with the ground truth, and (III)
a KL regularization loss that penalizes divergence between
the posterior \pro t ect  \mathcal  {N}(\boldsymbol {\mu }_p + \boldsymbol {\mu }_q, \boldsymbol {\Sigma }_q) and the prior distribution
\prot ect \mathcal  {N}(\boldsymbol {\mu }_p, \boldsymbol {\Sigma }_p). We introduce two auxiliary losses to further
shape the latent.
Lscale constrains the prior mean µp to
maintain unit magnitude, preventing degeneracy given hy-
persphere normalization. Ltc encourage consecutive prior
distributions to remain similar across time steps. Details of
these losses are provided in Sec. D.
3.4. InterPrior: Post-Training Beyond Reference
The distilled policy π (Sec. 3.3) exhibits goal following,
yet it is brittle when the goal or human-object state drifts
off the dataset distribution, e.g., during transitions between
skills.
Unlike human-only motion [36] or small-object
grasping [59], loco-manipulation tasks with coupled affor-
dances span a far larger configuration space that references
alone cannot cover. This follows from the learning dynam-
ics of distillation: training proceeds by replaying dataset
trajectories. Our key observation is that the pretrained π
provides a strong and natural initialization for RL finetun-
ing as a local optimizer that expands its scope along three
axes: (I) recover from near-failure or failure states, (II) ex-
plore unseen yet plausible configurations without trajectory
replay, and at the same time (III) preserve the naturalness
of behaviors encoded by the pretrained policy. A natural
alternative is to sample novel multi-frame trajectories that
combine diverse human, object, and contact configurations
and then train the policy to track them [37], but this requires
a strong trajectory sampler, which is particularly challeng-
ing at loco-manipulation scale. Instead, we target single-
frame goals: composing goals observed in data can induce
unseen configurations, and we further combine such goals
with randomized initializations and offsets to systematically
broaden the state distribution encountered during RL.
In-Betweening for Finetuning.
To mitigate the cost of
exhaustive trajectory sampling, we formulate finetuning as
an in-betweening task, where the policy tracks from a ran-
domly sampled initial configuration toward a single-frame
goal randomly drawn from the dataset. The policy is re-
warded for progressing toward this sampled goal. The re-
ward is defined as,
  \
b
e
g
in {ali g ne
d
}  r^{\ m athrm
 {PT} }
_
t &=\b
ig
 (r_{\ t ext {ene rgy
}}
 \ ti
me
s r_{\mathrm {h}}\big )\;+\;r_{\text {goal}}\;+\;r_{\mathrm {ter}},\\ r_{\text {goal}} &= \begin {cases} r_{\text {succ}}, & \text {if }\big \|{\boldsymbol {m}}_{t+L}\odot \Delta (\tilde {\boldsymbol {y}}_{t+L},\,\boldsymbol {x}_t)\big \|_1 < \tau ,\\[3pt] 0, & \text {otherwise.} \end {cases} \end {aligned} 
where the terms renergy, rter, and rh are defined in Sec. 3.2.
Since the goal is arbitrary by the random masking, we do
not use a dense distance-based reward. The goal reward
rgoal provides a sparse success signal that activates when the
masked feature distance between the current state xt and
target ˜yt+L falls below a threshold τ. r_{\text {succ}} is a constant.
Learning New Skills. As shown in Figure 1, our RL fine-
tuning can expand the distilled policy by handling two com-
mon regimes. (I) In-distribution extensions reuse and com-
pose behaviors already supported by the demonstrations.
A representative example is regrasping, which arises nat-

===== PAGE 6 =====
urally from goal-conditioned in-betweening: training the
policy to reach goals from diverse initializations and per-
turbed states encourages self-correction from near-failure
outcomes without additional supervision.
(II) Out-of-
distribution skills must be learned explicitly when the re-
quired behavior is absent from the dataset. A representative
example is getting up. Following prior practice [44, 65], we
append a learnable token to the (Sec. 3.3) to indicate this
new subtask and add an auxiliary reward that encourages
upright posture and center-of-mass elevation (Sec. D).
Prior Preservation. During finetuning, rather than freez-
ing network components to mitigate catastrophic forgetting
as in prior work [44, 65], we adopt a simple multi-objective
schedule. Specifically, we maintain a subset of environ-
ments that continue optimizing the original distillation ob-
jective (Sec. 3.3), while the remaining environments per-
form RL finetuning (Sec. D). This anchors the policy to the
pretrained prior during adaptation without restricting model
capacity. Given the environment mixtures and the joint ex-
ecution of RL and distillation, we distribute tasks across
multiple GPUs and aggregate gradients via a map-reduce
scheme. Further details are provided in Sec. D.
4. Experiments
We evaluate InterPrior on two tasks: (I) full-reference track-
ing and (II) sparse goal following. The evaluation covers
snapshot, trajectory, and contact specification, as well as
their compositions. Since our goal representation is formed
by masking arbitrary subsets of targets, these settings sub-
sume a broad family of task formulations, ranging from
single-frame constraints to multi-step trajectories over dif-
ferent joints and contacts. We further study InterPrior as a
reusable prior for novel objects, and for tracking trajectories
generated by kinematic models (Sec. F).
Datasets.
We employ the InterAct [86] dataset with its
preprocessing, which features diverse daily interactions en-
compassing a wide range of subjects and objects. Follow-
ing [87], we use the OMOMO subset [28] repaired by their
teacher rollout. To assess generalizability, we apply Inter-
Prior to other InterAct subsets including selected data from
BEHAVE [3] and HODome [95]. We exclude interactions
dominated by soft-body dynamics (e.g., backpack shoulder
straps) when choosing evaluation examples.
Baselines and Tasks. We focus on baselines that cover di-
verse objects and skills and therefore omit methods that are
for single object or task-specific proficiency [44, 71, 91].
(I) Full-reference tracking. We compare against the orig-
inal InterMimic [87], with InterPrior, which supports full-
reference imitation by removing masks. Evaluations target
challenging regimes involving thin-object interactions and
initialization noise. (II) Sparse goal following. We evaluate
the complete InterPrior framework against adapted Masked-
Mimic [58, 59], to our task under identical goals, following
Figure 1: (a) Snapshot goals: a ground truth frame speci-
fies a few human joints or object position in the long term;
(b) Trajectory goals: a sequence of ground-truth keyframes
defines the a few joints or object trajectories; (c) Contact
goals: a contact schedule specifies the desired active con-
tact regions on objects, which will be converted to goals for
human joints; (d) Multi-goal chaining: To evaluate long-
horizon robustness, we concatenate three randomly sampled
ground-truth subgoals, each canonicalized with respect to
the preceding one. The concatenated sequence may include
a mixture of snapshot, trajectory, and contact-following seg-
ments, with randomized goal transitions. For consistency,
the same goals are used across all baselines; (e) Random
initialization: To test motion coverage, we initialize the hu-
manoid within five meters of the object and define the task
as lifting the object by 0.5 meters from its initial position.
Metrics. (I) Full-reference tracking. Following [87], we re-
port the following metrics: (a) Success Rate (SR): the pro-
portion of rollouts completed without violating the early-
termination criteria; (b) Human Position Error Eh (m): the
mean per-joint positional deviation between the simulated
and reference humans, excluding hands due to the missing
ground truth from the dataset; and (c) Object Position Error
Eo (m): the mean positional deviation between the simu-
lated and reference objects. (II) Sparse goal following. The
evaluation metrics include: (a) Success Rate (SR); (b) Hu-
man and Object Errors (Eh, Eo): the deviation from the
target goal state, computed over the unmasked region; and
(c) Failure Rate (Fail): proportion of rollouts that directly
fail e.g., fall. More details are presented in Sec. F.
Implementation Details. All control policies operate at
30 Hz in IsaacGym [41]. The imitation expert policy, along
with the encoder and decoder used during distillation, are
implemented as MLPs with hidden layers of (1024, 1024,
512). The prior network is a four-layer Transformer en-
coder, and the critics use the same MLP architecture for
expert training and RL finetuning. We retrain InterPrior on
the G1 embodiment using our three-stage paradigm. Dur-
ing the first stage, we incorporate additional rewards and
domain randomization to enhance stability on G1 and facil-
itate robust sim-to-sim transfer. All auxiliary rewards are
multiplied with the imitation reward in exponential form
exp(−·), except for the termination term, which is added
directly. The formulation of each G1-specific reward term
is provided in Table C, and the dynamics randomization
ranges used during training are summarized in Table D. We
exclude thin-geometry objects for G1 because we do not in-
clude dexterous hands supporting single-hand grasps.
4.1. Quantitative Results
(I) Full-reference tracking. Table 2 shows that InterPrior
achieves higher success rates under thin-geometry inter-
actions and initialization noise. While InterMimic attains

lower position error by strictly tracking the reference, Inter-
Prior sometimes yields slightly higher human position error
because it intentionally deviates when needed to re-align
contact, trading strict tracking for interaction completion.
(II) Goal-conditioned tasks. Under identical goal specifi-
cations (Table 1), InterPrior consistently improves success
and reduces errors, with the largest gains on long-horizon
multi-goal chaining and random-initialization stress tests.
Distillation-based policies (including InterPrior pre-RL) fit
the demonstration-induced state distribution; long rollouts
with goal switching can enter under-covered intermediate
states, causing drift and failure.
RL finetuning directly
trains the policy to reach sparse targets from diverse ini-
tializations, improving interpolation across goal sequences
and recovery from off-distribution states. The position er-
ror trends follow a goal-sparsity continuum: broader state
coverage benefits sparse goals more, and the gap narrows
as goals densify. With full-reference tracking (Table 2), In-
terMimic for strict tracking achieves the lowest errors.
4.2. Qualitative Results
(I) Full-reference tracking.
Figure 3 shows that Inter-
Mimic rigidly follows the reference but often fails to ac-
quire or maintain contact on thin geometries under pertur-
bations. In contrast, our tracking policy allows small, tar-
geted deviations to correct hand-object alignment, produc-
ing stable grasps and more reliable completion. (II) Long-
horizon tasks. Figures 4 and 1 show that InterPrior sustains
minute-long whole-body interaction with multiple objects

trained from OMOMO [28] demonstrates generalization to unseen
objects and interactions from BEHAVE [3] and HODome [95].
Figure 6. Qualitative results on sim-to-sim from IsaacGym [41]
to MuJoCo [62] with object trajectory as condition, showing a sus-
tained interaction involving box pickup, pushing, and kicking.
and smooth transitions across skills (e.g., approach, grasp,
lift, reposition). When drift begins (contact or balance), In-
terPrior self-corrects instead of compounding errors, con-
sistent with the robustness induced by RL finetuning. (III)
Novel objects and interactions. Figures 5 and 7 demonstrate
zero-shot generalization to unseen objects and interaction
styles. Guided only by sparse snapshot goals, InterPrior
complete unspecified degrees of freedom and converge to
feasible contact, even the original data in BEHAVE [3] and
HODome [95] is for different human shape.
(IV) Sim-
to-sim transfer.
Figure 6 illustrates transfer from Isaac-
Gym [41] to MuJoCo [62]: InterPrior maintains coherent
long-horizon interactions under object-conditioned goals,
showing the potential to transfer to the real world.
4.3. Ablation Study
We conduct a cumulative ablation study reported in Table 1.
Starting from a MaskedMimic baseline with an InterMimic
expert, we progressively enable the components of Inter-
Prior: upgrading to an InterMimic+ expert, incorporating
the latent shaping loss, bounding both latent and observa-
tion spaces, and finally applying RL finetuning.
Impact of Latent Shaping and Bounding. Introducing
the latent shaping loss yields modest improvements on in-
distribution tasks but provides clear gains for long-horizon
behavior and under random initialization. This indicates
that a well-shaped and properly bounded latent is essential
for mitigating drift in challenging, contact-rich interactions.
Effectiveness of Finetuning. Comparing the full InterPrior
model with the variant before finetuning shows that RL fine-
tuning chiefly enhances robustness. The improvement is
also more pronounced on stress tests, suggesting that fine-

tuning helps the policy exploring the feasible motion space
and recover from distributional shift, while maintaining the
policy with similar precision on standard tasks.
Impact of Finetuning on Trajectory Following. As dis-
cussed in Sec. 3.4, our in-betweening finetuning is applied
only on snapshot goals rather than full trajectories, which
may raise concerns about degrading trajectory-following
performance.
However, as shown in Table 1, trajectory
following is well preserved for two reasons: (I) the fine-
tuning procedure does not alter the model under trajectory-
conditioned inputs, which are explicitly protected by a con-
current distillation loss; and (II) we redefine a snapshot goal
if deviations from the target trajectory appears, and thus
trajectory-following can implicitly benefit from the RL fine-
tuning on snapshot goal following.
Scalable Prior. Beyond the generalization results in Fig-
ure 5, Table 2 and Figure 7 further demonstrate that Inter-
Prior scales more robustly to novel objects and interactions,
with or without finetuning, compared to the full-reference
InterMimic baseline. A key factor is the prevalent dataset
imperfections. For example, in Figure 7, baselines fail as
contact artifacts cause failure initialization, whereas Inter-
Prior can re-establish contact and continue the task. This
flexibility allows the learned model to better absorb addi-
tional interaction data, even when such data are imperfect.
Failure Cases. Despite its improved robustness over the
baselines, InterPrior still exhibits failure modes, as shown
in Figure A. The human loses contact and moves with-
out the object, whereas the baseline demonstrates a signifi-
cantly higher failure rate, often resulting in human fall. We
find typical failure scenarios include: (I) challenges with
extremely thin or elongated objects that were unseen dur-
ing training; and (II) partial goal completion in multi-goal
chaining, where canonicalization introduces large align-
ment discrepancies, leading the policy to favor maintaining
balance over achieving precise goal configurations.
5. Conclusion
We present InterPrior, a physics-based generative motion
controller that scales human-object interaction by com-
bining large-scale imitation distillation with reinforcement
finetuning. Using a distilled, goal-conditioned latent pol-
icy and optimizing it with RL yields a controller that
maintains natural whole-body coordination while substan-
tially improving robustness and competence. It composes
loco-manipulation skills, transitions smoothly, and recov-
ers from failures across diverse contact and dynamic condi-
tions. This decoupled recipe broadens task, skill, and dy-
namics coverage while enabling interactive control and can
be applied to different embodiments. We hope this scalable
paradigm to provide a practical recipe for humanoid loco-
manipulation. Future directions include integrating percep-
tion, language-conditioned goals, and richer affordances to
advance InterPrior toward robust sim-to-real assistive ma-
nipulation and teleoperation.

A. Demo Video
The demo video on the webpage visualizes behaviors pro-
duced by InterPrior across settings detailed in the follow-
ing. All sequences are rendered from the physics simula-
tor [41, 62] using the same SMPL [32, 51] and G1 [64]
model as for training. No post-processing is applied other
than camera selection and cropping for visualization.
Core Capability. We show examples of snapshot, trajec-
tory, and contact-conditioned control corresponding to the
scenarios illustrated in Figure 1 of the main paper, for ob-
jects with diverse shapes.
Failure Recovery and Regrasping. We visualize rollouts
perturbed or initialized from failure states. The video high-
lights re-approaching, re-grasping, and recovery from falls
as described in Sec. 3.4.
Long-Horizon Multi-Goal Chains. We include long se-
quences where three canonicalized sub-goals are chained
(Sec. 4, “Chain” tasks) and the policy must transition
smoothly between different interaction while maintaining
task success.
Diverse Task Execution from the Same Goal. We show
that our model is able to control the simulated human
achieving the same task with different execution.
Baseline Comparison.
We demonstrate that InterPrior
achieves superior performance compared to existing base-
line methods [58, 59, 87].
Novel Interaction Generalization. We visualize qualita-
tive results on BEHAVE [3] and HODome [95], as a com-
plementary to Figure 5 and Figure 7 in the main paper.
Interaction with multiple objects. We showcase that In-
terPrior supports human interactions with multiple objects,
without requiring any task-specific training.
Sim-to-Sim for G1. We include more examples of the G1
humanoid with sim-to-sim transfer, as a complementary to
Figure 6, for controlling a humanoid only based on object
future snapshot goal.
Interactive Steering Control. Finally, we show real-time
keyboard control where a user steers high-level goals and
InterPrior produces coherent whole-body motion online.
B. Simulation
All experiments are performed in IsaacGym [41] with the
GPU PhysX backend. Control policies run at 30Hz, while
the simulator is stepped at 60Hz with two internal substeps
per control step. The main simulation hyperparameters are
summarized in Table A.
We introduce a small object rest offset to reduce human-
object interpenetration, especially for thin geometries. Al-
though this slightly enlarges the effective collision bound-
ary, it avoids the substantial cost associated with increasing

C. Goal Formulation
This section details the construction of snapshot, trajectory,
and contact goals and the associated masks used. Specifi-
cally, a goal state yt shares the same structure as the obser-
vation xt, and a binary mask mt indicates which compo-
nents of yt are provided to the policy.
C.1. Horizon for Goals
Short-Horizon Preview. We use a small set of offsets K =
{1, 2, 4, 16} to provide short-horizon previews relative to
the current timestep t. For each offset k ∈K, we construct
a goal pair (yt+k, mt+k).
Long-Horizon Snapshot.
A long-horizon offset sam-
pled by L
∈
[1, 128] defines a single far-future goal
(yt+L, mt+L). During training, L is initialized randomly
at the start of each episode and then decremented each
timestep, being resampled once it reaches zero. Although
termed a long-horizon snapshot, its value naturally de-
creases at each step and may temporarily fall below the
short-horizon offsets.
C.2. Stochastic Mask Sampling during Training
During training, masks are not tied to specific tasks (snap-
shot; trajectory; contact).
Instead, we randomly decide
which parts of the future state are revealed to the policy,
so that the policy is exposed to a wide variety of partial and
sparse goals, following [58]. We operate at the level of rigid
bodies, including objects with following three rules:
Body-Wise Masking. Visibility is enforced at the body
level. For each rigid body, we maintain a single binary vari-
able. If it is false, all all state features associated with that
body at time t+k are masked out, positions, orientations,
and linear and angular velocities. The same rule applies to
the entries in the interaction vectors Dt+k and the contact
state Ct+k, defined in Sect. 3.1, which are masked or re-
vealed together.
Independent Sampling in Rigid Bodies. At each horizon
offset k, each body is sampled independently according to
a fixed Bernoulli distribution: human-state and interaction
components are revealed with probability 0.1, and object
components with probability 0.5. This procedure produces
diverse, randomly constructed combinations of visible and
masked human, object, and contact features, rather than re-
lying on any task-specific mask templates.
Temporal Consistency of Masks.
To avoid flickering
visibility, masks evolve over time with a high probability
of staying the same and a small probability of being re-
sampled.
Concretely, for k > 1 we define a first-order
Markov process:
  \b o
l
dsymbol
 m_{ t+k} = \beg i n  {cases
} \boldsymbol m_
{t+k -1}, & \tex t {with probability } 1 - p_{\text {reset}},\\ \text {Bernoulli}(\boldsymbol p_{\text {vis}}), & \text {with probability } p_{\text {reset}}. \end {cases} 
Here preset = 0.01 ensures that once a body is masked or
unmasked, it tends to remain in that state for multiple steps,
while occasional resets still diversify the masks. The visi-
bility probabilities pvis follow the design above.
C.3. Task Definition for Inference
During inference, masks are constructed according to the
target task. For a given task, the visibility pattern remains
fixed throughout the rollout.
The only exception is the
multi-goal chaining setting, where we resample a new mask
whenever the controller transitions to the next sub-goal.
Snapshot-Conditioned Control.
We unmask the long-
horizon snapshot. We still apply the consistent per-body
sampling to determine which body or object components
are revealed. All short-horizon preview are fully masked.
Trajectory-Conditioned Control. We unmask the short-
horizon preview. Following the same per-body sampling,
we reveal only a subset of the joint or object components.
The long-horizon snapshot goal is retained.
Contact-Conditioned Control. Contact goals are imple-
mented as a special case of snapshot conditioning in which
we reveal only contact-related information. Specifically, we
unmask the contact entries of Ct, the associated signed-
distance fields Dt (defined in Sec. 3.1), and the relevant
human body parts. To avoid ambiguity in the target, we
additionally unmask the object pose in the snapshot frame.
Multi-Goal Chaining. For multi-goal chains, we extract
data by concatenating different data sequences.
Specifi-
cally, we canonicalize each subsequent first frame with re-
spect to the previous last frame. Canonicalization is per-
formed by aligning the human root position (excluding
2


===== PAGE 15 =====
height), and heading, i.e., rotation around the vertical z–axis
only, rather than the full SO(3) orientation. Because this
transformation is applied with respect to the human frame
only, the object frame may become partially misaligned af-
ter canonicalization. As a result, we do not expect the pol-
icy to perfectly satisfy all chained goals, especially when
object-relative alignment becomes extremely inconsistent.
Nevertheless, the presence of a long horizon makes the pol-
icy possibly compensate for canonicalization artifacts.
D. Additional Details on Methodology
This section expands the reward and loss formulations, as
well as additional details for the three stages of our frame-
work: (I) InterMimic+ expert training (extending Sec. 3.2),
(II) variational distillation (extending Sec. 3.3), and (III)
RL post-training (extending Sec. 3.4).
D.1. InterMimic+: Full-Reference Imitation Ex-
pert
Reference-Free Reward for Expert. Here we introduce
the detailed formulation of the hand reward rh. Let \protect \boldsymbol  {p}_T de-
note the position of the thumb fingertip and \ifmmode \lbrace \else \textbraceleft \fi \boldsymbol {p}_j\}_{j \in S}
the
positions of the other fingertips, with \protect \boldsymbol  {q}_T and \ifmmode \lbrace \else \textbraceleft \fi \boldsymbol {q}_j\}_{j \in S}
be-
ing their respective nearest surface points on the object.
We define unit bearing vectors from the object surface to-
ward the fingertips as \p
r ote ct \bold sym bol  {u}_T = (\boldsymbol {p}_T {-} \boldsymbol {q}_T)/\|\boldsymbol {p}_T {-} \boldsymbol {q}_T\| and
\p r otect \bold s ymbol  {u}_j = (\boldsymbol {p}_j {-} \boldsymbol {q}_j)/\|\boldsymbol {p}_j - \boldsymbol {q}_j\|, j  \in S. The reward is defined as
r_ { \mathrm {h}} = \exp (-w_{\mathrm {h}} e_{\mathrm {h}}), where e_ { \m a
thr
m
 {h
}} =
 1 
{-} \frac {1}{|S|} \sum _{j \in S} \frac {1 - \boldsymbol {u}_T^\top \boldsymbol {u}_j}{2}
, and
w_{\mathrm {h}} increases as the hand-object distance decreases, activat-
ing only when the reference indicates an upcoming interac-
tion. This reward encourages all five fingers to maximize
upcoming surface contact with the object.
D.2. InterPrior: Variational Distillation
Here we introduce the formulation for our proposed losses
for variational Distillation. Let µp,t and Σp,t denote the
prior’s mean and covariance at time t, i.e., N(µp,t, Σp,t) ≡
pψ(zt | xt−ℓ:t, Gt).
(I) Scale loss. We regularize the prior mean to lie on the
unit hypersphere. This is to prevent the output mean from
collapsing or exploding, with the use of latent normaliza-
tion:
  \mat h ca
l 
{L}_{\t e x
t {
scale}} = \mathbb {E}_t\bigl [\bigl (\|\boldsymbol {\mu }_{p,t}\|_2 - 1\bigr )^2\bigr ]. 
(II) Temporal consistency loss. To obtain a smooth latent
prior over time, we use Ltc to penalize changes in the prior
distribution across consecutive timesteps using the squared
2-Wasserstein distance between Gaussians.
(III) Goal reconstruction loss. The decoder includes an ad-
ditional head that predicts future goal features conditioned
on the latent. Let byt+k denote the predicted goal at offset
k and mt+k the input mask used to construct the masked
residual goal. We train this head to complete the masked
entries of the goal, i.e., those that were hidden from the pol-
icy input. Formally, the goal reconstruction loss is
  \ma t hcal
 {L}
_ { \tex
t
 
{goal} }  = \
math
b
b
 {E}_{t,k}\bigl [ \bigl \| \bigl (\mathbf {1} - \boldsymbol {m}_{t+k}\bigr ) \odot \bigl (\widehat {\boldsymbol {y}}_{t+k} - \boldsymbol {y}_{t+k}\bigr ) \bigr \|_2^2 \bigr ], 
where ⊙denotes element-wise multiplication and 1 is an
all-ones vector. This loss encourages the latent zt to capture
intent and context sufficient to reconstruct the missing parts
of the goal, given only the visible subset provided by the
mask. In practice, we reconstruct short future with k = 1.
D.3. InterPrior: Post-Training Beyond Reference
Get-Up Training. To learn the get-up behavior, in addition
to the new learnable token as discussed in Sec. 3.4, we intro-
duce an auxiliary reward that becomes active, with episodes
initialized from a fallen state. The reward encourages both
elevation of the pelvis and reorientation of the torso toward
an upright configuration:
  r^{\ t ext {ge t
u
p} }  = w_{\
t
e xt {heig h
t
}}  \, 
\
sigma \!\bigl (h_t - h_{\text {target}}\bigr ) \;+\; w_{\text {upright}} \, \sigma \!\bigl (\mathbf {n}_t \cdot \mathbf {n}_{\text {up}}\bigr ), (1)
where ht is the pelvis height, htarget is set as 0.7, nt is the
torso’s up vector, nup is the world up direction, and σ(·)
denotes a clipped linear shaping function.
Distributed Training. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting,
we divide the parallel simulation environments into three
groups: (I) RL environments, optimized solely with the
post-training reward rPT
t ; (II) Distillation environments, op-
timized using the ELBO objective and supervised by the
expert policy, as described in Sec. 3.3. The policy param-
eters are shared across all environments. Gradients are ag-
gregated synchronously to update the shared policy.
Mask Prompt Engineering during Inference.
To fur-
ther enhance robustness during inference without additional
learning, we apply lightweight mask-based prompting over
the goal specification Gt (Sec. 3.1): (I) When following
a trajectory and the state lags behind, we remove the tra-
jectory goal but redefine the nearest waypoint as the snap-
shot goal. (II) For snapshot goals with distant target joints
(>1 m), we retain only the root translation goal while mask-
ing out all other components, prompting locomotion be-
fore fine manipulation. (III) When human-object targets
are contradictory, e.g., both are moving but no grasp is es-
tablished, we set the human root goal to the current object
position while maintaining root height, masking all other
joints. This encourages natural re-approach and regrasping
behaviors. These inference-time edits operate solely on the
goal Gt, while the policy parameters remain fixed.
Finetuning on Additional HOI Datasets. The same fine-
tuning mechanism naturally extends to absorbing new in-
teraction datasets. Given any additional HOI corpus (e.g.,
BEHAVE [3] or HODome [95] in Sec. 4), states from such
new dataset are treated as additional sources of long-horizon
goals and initializations for RL rollouts, while the distil-
lation group continues to regularize the policy toward the

original prior. This allows InterPrior to incrementally ac-
quire new object categories and interaction styles without
retraining from scratch.
E. Implementation Details
This section summarizes key implementation details, in-
cluding network configurations, hyperparameters, random-
ization settings used for expert training, and additional tech-
niques used during G1 training for sim-to-sim experiments.
PPO Setup. For both the expert and RL finetuning stages,
we use PPO with generalized advantage estimation (GAE)
and a clipped surrogate objective, and train with Adam. Fol-
lowing common practice [46], we keep the PPO discount
factor γ, GAE parameter λ, clip ratio, and entropy regular-
ization as shown in Table B, and apply gradient clipping.
InterMimic+: Full-Reference Imitation Expert. The In-
terMimic+ expert policy and critic are MLPs with three hid-
den layers of sizes (1024, 1024, 512), using ReLU activa-
tions. Actor and critic are parameterized separately, and the
critic outputs a scalar value with full observation and refer-
ence as input. Please refer to [87] for more details.
InterPrior: Variational Distillation. The encoder and de-
coder used for variational distillation share the same MLP
backbone with hidden sizes (1024, 1024, 512). The prior
pψ is implemented as a 4-layer Transformer encoder with
4 attention heads, a latent dimension of 512, and a feedfor-
ward width of 1024. For the distillation objective (Sec. D),
we use unit weight for the action reconstruction loss, and
assign a weight of 10−3 to all auxiliary terms (goal recon-
struction, scale loss, and temporal consistency loss). The
KL regularizer follows a β-VAE style schedule: the KL
weight β is annealed from 10−3 to 1.0 over the course of
training. We first perform 500 epochs of warm-up using
only teacher-controlled rollouts, and then gradually increase
the fraction of student-controlled rollouts [52] until epoch
10, 000, at which point 95% of environments are driven by
the student policy while the remaining 5% always use the
teacher for fresh expert trajectories.
InterPrior: Post-Training Beyond Reference.
For the
post-training stage, we retain the same loss weights used
for the distillation branch, and combine with the PPO loss
weights specified in Table B for the RL branches.
Inference Efficiency. The runtime breakdown is: observa-
tion 20.16,ms, physics 19.02,ms, policy inference 0.43,ms,
SDF 0.134,ms, and other overheads 0.057,ms, highlighting
the policy’s potential for real-world deployment.

mentary qualitative results, and discuss failure cases.

comparing the rollout state with the corresponding refer-
ence, and compute pose and object errors only over the
unmasked components. For snapshot goal-following tasks,
there is no time-aligned reference trajectory. Instead, we
compute the error between the rollout state and the snap-
shot goal at every timestep and report the minimum of this
distance over the rollout. This reflects whether the policy is
capable of reaching the target configuration.

Integration with Kinematic HOI Generators. To demon-
strate that InterPrior’s generalization, we integrate it with
InterDiff [83] that produces physically unconstrained inter-
action trajectories. The integration proceeds as follows: (I)
the kinematic generator produces a 25 frames of human-
object poses given the past 15 frames following [83]; (II)
we convert these sequences into our goal representation by
extracting snapshot and trajectory goals; and (III) we feed
these goals into InterPrior. The result is shown in Figure C.

generated by InterDiff [83] (yellow and red dots). InterPrior adap-
tively completes the task without strictly adhering to the targets,
using only sparse inputs of wrist, feet, and object target.
G. Discussion
Limitations and Future Work. InterPrior is still bounded
by the coverage and quality of its training data: highly cor-
rupted or unseen interaction patterns are not reliably recov-
ered, and in such cases the policy often defaults to con-
servative strategies, maintaining balance without fully solv-
ing the task. Our model is tailored to rigid object, and we
still observe occasional artifacts such as shallow interpen-
etrations, foot skating, or failure cases such as object drop
over long rollouts. The current hand and contact represen-
tation is also not designed for fine-grained finger dexter-
ity or in-hand manipulation. Finally, our three-stage train-
ing introduces additional complexity and hyperparameters.
Future work includes expanding dataset diversity, incorpo-
rating richer hand models, and simplifying or unifying the
training scheme.
Societal and Ethical Considerations. InterPrior enables
more general-purpose, physically grounded humanoid con-
troller, which can be beneficial for animation, simulation,
and robotics, but also raises potential risks. More capable
humanoid controllers could be deployed in unsafe settings
or for applications that conflict with societal norms (e.g.,
surveillance or coercive scenarios). We therefore encourage
careful consideration of safety mechanisms, usage policies,
and ethical guidelines when applying this type of model be-
yond controlled research environments.

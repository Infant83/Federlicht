It is not incorrect, but why ask the same thing twice?

Needing additional information is the same as having questions.

“If you need additional information, please let me know” communicates all that you wish to. It is enough. Twice is too much.

I used to write, ““If you require any further information/clarification, please let me know.”. My short sentence covered the Two main areas where people might have been unsure of what I meant, or needed more information. Hope this was helpful.

It’s pretty much always okay to say anything you want to say, at least if you’re a citizen of a developed, “Western” country like the United States, Canada, Brazil, Japan, Argentina, South Africa, Australia, the nations comprising the European Union, and many others. Shadowy, dark-cloaked figures with dubious motives aren’t going to pop up out of nowhere to reprimand you for saying something that isn’t “okay” by some arbitrary standard.

It’s pretty much always okay to say anything you want to say, at least if you’re a citizen of a developed, “Western” country like the United States, Canada, Brazil, Japan, Argentina, South Africa, Australia, the nations comprising the European Union, and many others. Shadowy, dark-cloaked figures with dubious motives aren’t going to pop up out of nowhere to reprimand you for saying something that isn’t “okay” by some arbitrary standard.

Having said that, while there is nothing per se wrong with the statement you’re asking about, the statement itself, as phrased, is more than a bit awkward. I would venture to say that few, if any, people wouldn’t know what you’re trying to convey with the statement—the meaning is pretty clear and straightforward, after all—but to the ears of probably most native English speakers, the statement sounds rigid, unnatural, and redundant.

The word “it” at the end of the sentence is wholly unnecessary. Get rid of it. And the phrase “please let me know” is off-sounding in that it follows a clause that ends with the same verb (i.e., “to know”). Again, there is nothing wrong grammatically with using the same verb back-to-back, but it’s noticeably awkward. I would suggest rewording to avoid this awkwardness. Try this:

> Please let me know if you would like any additional information.

The sentence is clearer, more concise, and less awkward this way.

It doesn’t make a lot of sense.

Try "If there is any additional information that you would like to know, please feel free to ask”

That avoids two different types of know

How can I effectively edit my own writing?

So, you think you’ve drafted a tweet, an email, a short story, or even a novel. These are different forms of communication, but the process of bringing them to fruition has a necessary, sometimes overlooked step: editing! Unless you’re a professional writer, it’s unlikely that you have an editor who can review your writing regularly. Here are some tips to help you review your own work.

1. Give your writing some space. 
   Have you ever felt a mix of pure relief and joy when you’ve finished a draft of something? Don’t downplay that feeling and the ability to walk away from your work before you start ed

So, you think you’ve drafted a tweet, an email, a short story, or even a novel. These are different forms of communication, but the process of bringing them to fruition has a necessary, sometimes overlooked step: editing! Unless you’re a professional writer, it’s unlikely that you have an editor who can review your writing regularly. Here are some tips to help you review your own work.

1. Give your writing some space. 
   Have you ever felt a mix of pure relief and joy when you’ve finished a draft of something? Don’t downplay that feeling and the ability to walk away from your work before you start editing it. You may need minutes, hours, or days, but once you sit back down with what you originally had on the page, you’ll have the thrill of looking at it with fresh eyes. You’ll notice errors you may not have seen the first time. You’ll come to new realizations about its overall tone and structure. If it’s a text or email, maybe you only need a few minutes away from it. If it’s a story or essay, perhaps you’ll need longer. Regardless of what type of work it is, it will help your writing tremendously.
2. Don’t use overachieving synonyms.
    Looking at your work for the second, third, or fourth time around may inspire you to spice up your language with longer, more uncommon words. There’s nothing wrong with having a thesaurus nearby, but try to limit the repetition of long, pretentious-feeling words so your work flows well and doesn’t feel too bogged down. At the end of the day, you want it to feel true to you and the message you’re conveying.
3. Remember who the reader is. 
   Don’t forget your own voice as the writer—but don’t forget who your reader is. Many writers get too close to their work; editing is a chance to try to get out of your own head. Who is your ideal reader? What do you want them to take away from the writing? It’s a unique time to step in their shoes, to make sure your communication is as effective as you’d like it to be.
4. Kill your darlings. 
   Don’t be scared to remove chunks of your work, even if it feels precious to you. If it’s a passage that’s really tough to part with, try saving it somewhere else, so you can return to it later in your piece or for another work.
5. Use Grammarly. 
   Last but not least,

The sentence is understandable but slightly awkward. It mixes two verbs incorrectly and isn’t the most natural or concise way to offer further help. Better alternatives:

* "If there is any additional information you would like to know, please let me know."
* "If you would like any additional information, please let me know."
* "Please let me know if you would like any additional information."
* "If you need any further information, please let me know."

Notes for nuance:

* Use "further" or "additional" — both work; "further" is slightly more formal and common in offers of assistance.

* Place the request to be informed ("please let me know") after the condition for smoother flow.
* For very formal contexts, prefer: "Should you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me."

Yes, but your version is too wordy and empty of purpose. Try a phrase like this: “I hope to meet with you soon to discuss my qualifications.“ Or this shorter version: I look forward to a deeper discussion of these points.” Don't waste valuable real estate and recruiter time being overly formal or verbose! And make sure your cover letter doesn't simply regurgitate your resume. The cover letter is an opportunity to flesh out your best achievements directly
 relative to the job 
to which you're applying. Good luck!

How do I get my IQ tested?

What is a good IQ score, and how do you know where you stand?

IQ, or Intelligence Quotient, is often misunderstood. Many people think it’s just a number—but it’s actually a snapshot of how your brain processes information, solves problems, reasons logically, and recognizes patterns. Understanding your IQ can give you valuable insight into your cognitive strengths—and help you figure out where you stand compared to others.

What Does an IQ Score Actually Mean?

IQ scores are standardized so that the average score is 100. Most people score between 85 and 115. If you're in that range, you're right in the middle of the bell curve. But some individuals score higher—and a score of 130 or above is generally considered “gifted.”

This doesn’t mean you have to be a genius to do well in life. But it does mean you might think differently, solve problems more quickly, or absorb new concepts with

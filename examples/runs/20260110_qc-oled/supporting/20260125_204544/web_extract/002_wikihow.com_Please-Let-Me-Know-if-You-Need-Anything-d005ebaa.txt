### Ways to Offer Support to Friends & Loved Ones

1. 1

   **“If you need anything, just let me know.”** This variation of the phrase is a friendly and less formal way to show someone you’re there for them. It’s still professional enough to send to a coworker, but it can also be used to offer [support](/Give-Emotional-Support "Give Emotional Support") to a friend or loved one in a more personal setting. Here are some examples:[[1]](#_note-1) X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience) Mind U.K.-based mental health charity focused on providing advice and resources to anyone facing mental health problems. [Go to source](#) 
   * “Hey Jacob, of course I can bring some extra dessert for the party—don’t worry at all! If you need anything else, just let me know.”
   * “Hi Maisie! I heard you've been feeling down this week. I’m so sorry! I wanted to text you to check-in. If you need anything, just let me know!”
   * “Dear Parker, I was so sorry to hear about your dad’s passing. He was a truly special man, and I feel so lucky to have known him. If you need anything at all, just let me know. I’m here for you!”
2. 2

   **Consider offering specific, practical help to the person who’s struggling.** It’s definitely appropriate to say “Please let me know if you need anything,” but there may be better ways to show your support. This phrase puts the pressure on them to figure out what help they need, which can be stressful if they’re already going through a difficult event. Instead, try offering to [help them](/Help-Others "Help Others") with everyday tasks.[[2]](#_note-2) X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience) Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public [Go to source](#)  This takes some things off of their plate and gives them a much-needed reprieve!
   * For example, to [support a friend who has depression](/Help-a-Friend-with-Depression "Help a Friend with Depression"), offer to come over to tidy their place up, do some laundry, or cook a yummy meal.[[3]](#_note-3) X Research source  Just be sure to ask if this is okay first, rather than showing up unannounced.
   * If you want to help a grieving friend, let them know you’re available to bring over takeout or pre-cooked meals for their family, drop their kids off at school, or help out with chores like laundry or grocery shopping.[[4]](#_note-4) X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience) HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. [Go to source](#)
   * If they aren't up for visitors, consider [sending them a self-care box](/Make-a-Self-Care-Box "Make a Self Care Box"). Fill the box up with comforting, relaxing gifts, like essential oils, bath bombs, a cozy blanket, candles, or yummy snacks.[[5]](#_note-5) X Research source

Scientist at Mitsubishi Chemical and IBM initiated a joint research project with collaborators at JSR and Keio University to calculate the excited states of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters which are applied to the fabrication of efficient OLEDs. The parties have developed a new scheme to mitigate the error from current noisy quantum computers and succeeded in improving the calculation accuracy. This is the world-first research case of applying quantum computers to excited states calculations of commercial materials. We expect the proposed error mitigation scheme, together with the [...] calculations with the use of quantum computers have been proposed. These algorithms are expected to be useful to perform calculations of large systems that have not been possible on classical computers. On the other hand, most benchmark calculation for the validation of these algorithms in the literature were only applied to simple molecular systems such as H2, LiH and for the complicated chemical systems few surveys of the ability of these algorithms has been carried out. Moreover, due to the error in quantum computer, it is difficult to achieve chemical accuracy for the calculations on current device. The goal of the work is to use two quantum algorithms (qEOM-VQE and VQD algorithms) to reliably predict excited states energies of TADF materials which is used as a kind of OLED emitters.", "score": 0.30794093, "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/7/1299", "title": "Overcoming Challenges in OLED Technology for Lighting Solutions", "content": "79.

[Google Scholar] [CrossRef] [...] An OLED device consists of a multilayer structure (Figure 2) [22,23,24], traditionally emitting through a substrate (bottom-emitting OLED), primarily composed of an emissive layer (EML) sandwiched between a transparent anode (commonly based on indium tin oxide, ITO), deposited on a transparent substrate, and an opaque metal cathode. In the emissive layer, the injected charges, electrons, and holes meet to form excitons, which are excited molecule states. A top-emitting device has the same structure but with a transparent top electrode, and the substrate can also be opaque. The third possible configuration, particularly interesting for lighting applications, is that of a transparent OLED (TrOLED), where emission occurs through both electrodes, which must therefore be transparent. These can [...] While, in the field of academic research, tremendous advancements have been made in terms of luminous efficacy, one of the key factors for lighting applications, reaching values as high as 160 lm/W in recent years , in the industry, field OLEDs have to compete with their inorganic counterparts. Certainly, they are competitive regarding the ability to obtain large-area and flexible panels with a customizable design and tunable chromaticity in a wide range, but further efforts are needed to narrow the gap in terms of efficiency. The first meaningful results in terms of area and efficiency were achieved by GE Global Research, which, in 2004, fabricated a 2 ft × 2 ft white OLED panel with a CCT of 4400 K, a CRI of 88, and efficacy of 15 lm/W .

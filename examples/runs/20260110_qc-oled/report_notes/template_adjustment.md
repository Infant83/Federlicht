## Guidance Overrides
- Risks & Gaps: Identify potential risks associated with quantum computing applications in material research, and outline gaps in current understanding or methodologies.
- Critics: Present arguments and criticisms regarding the use of quantum computing in OLED material development, addressing both theory and practical implications.

## Writer Guidance Additions
- Focus on the implications of quantum computing in the context of OLED material research.
- Ensure to articulate both the strengths and weaknesses of the current development approaches, supported by precise evidence.
- Critically evaluate the existing criticisms while providing counterarguments where necessary.

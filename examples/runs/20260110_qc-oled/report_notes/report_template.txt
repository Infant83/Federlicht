Guidance:
Template description: Review of Modern Physics-style deep technical survey.

Template tone: Scholarly, rigorous, method-heavy.

Template audience: Domain experts.

Section guidance:
- Abstract: concise scope and main results; signal limits.
- Introduction: define scope and notation; position in literature.
- Theory & Foundations: include equations or formal definitions.
- Methods & Experimental Evidence: detail setups, datasets, or protocols.
- Applications & Benchmarks: compare representative systems and metrics.
- Synthesis & Outlook: reconcile findings and articulate open problems.
- Risks & Gaps: highlight missing evidence, constraints, and unknowns. If not applicable, state Not applicable and give a brief reason; scale depth to evidence strength and context.
- Critics: short headline + paragraphs + bullets; include contrarian views. If not applicable, state Not applicable and give a brief reason; scale depth to evidence strength and context.

Template writing guidance:
Assume expert audience; be explicit about assumptions.
Include precise references and methodological caveats.

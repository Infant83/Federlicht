Abstract
Developing new fluorophores for advanced imaging techniques re-
quires exploring new chemical space. While generative AI approaches
have shown promise in designing novel dye scaffolds, prior efforts often
produced synthetically intractable candidates due to a lack of reac-
tion constraints.
Here, we developed SyntheFluor-RL, a generative
AI model that employs known reaction libraries and molecular build-
ing blocks to create readily synthesizable fluorescent molecule scaffolds
via reinforcement learning. To guide the generation of fluorophores,
SyntheFluor-RL employs a scoring function built on multiple graph
neural networks (GNNs) that predict key photophysical properties, in-
cluding photoluminescence quantum yield, absorption, and emission
wavelengths. These outputs are dynamically weighted and combined

Introduction
Fluorescent dyes with highly optimized photophysical properties are criti-
cal for advanced imaging methods to detect and interrogate biomolecules
[38, 7].
A variety of microscopy techniques, such as STORM (Stochas-
tic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy), PALM (Photoactivated Localiza-
tion Microscopy) [19, 14], single-molecule FRET (Fluorescence Resonance
Energy Transfer)[34], single-particle tracking (SPT), light-sheet microscopy
[33], multi-photon fluorescence microscopy[11], and fluorescence recovery af-
ter photobleaching (FRAP), have significantly enhanced our ability to in-
vestigate cellular structures and processes with improved spatio-temporal
resolution. As these methodologies evolve, the demand for a diverse array
of fluorescent dyes—each characterized by unique photophysical properties
tailored to each specific imaging technique—becomes increasingly critical.
For example, techniques such as SPT would benefit from dyes that are longer
lived, whereas FRAP would benefit from dyes that are rapidly bleached.
Four primary families of dye scaffolds dominate the field of bioimag-
ing: coumarins, xanthenes (such as fluorescein and rhodamine), BODIPYs,
and cyanines[6, 32].
These scaffolds form the basis for 29 Alexa Fluor
dyes, 50 ATTO dyes, 6 Cy dyes, and at least 15 Janelia Fluor dyes, col-
lectively addressing a broad range of imaging needs. Additionally, alterna-
tive scaffolds such as pyrene, naphthalene, carbazole, oxazine, porphyrin,
benzothia(dia)zole, squaraine, and phthalocyanine have found more limited
applications [21, 31]. Advances in dye chemistry continue to drive the discov-
ery of new scaffolds and the development of synthetic routes for novel dyes
with tailored photophysical properties, enabling higher imaging resolution
and compatibility with modern imaging modalities [16].
Recently, machine learning models have emerged as transformative tools

for designing novel dye scaffolds. In one approach, trained property pre-
dictors based on characteristics such as photoluminescence quantum yield
(PLQY), absorption, and emission are used to identify promising fluores-
cent molecules within databases of known compounds [45, 50, 18, 15, 2].
While this method effectively uncovers novel candidates, generative models
offer the capability to rapidly explore a broader chemical space and create
entirely new scaffolds that are absent from existing fluorophore libraries or
databases. Despite the potential of generative AI approaches to discover
novel fluorescent molecular structures [37, 41, 53], they often face challenges
due to the generation of synthetically intractable scaffolds.
In this study, we developed SyntheFluor-RL, a generative AI model, to
assemble readily synthesizable fluorescent molecule scaffolds. SyntheFluor-
RL, a variant of the generative model SyntheMol-RL [39], assembles novel
molecules using building blocks and well-established synthetic reactions avail-
able in the Enamine REAL Space [12], which contains over 30 billion pos-
sible molecules.
SyntheFluor-RL was specifically adapted for fluorescent
molecule design by training graph neural network-based property predic-
tor models on the ChemFluor dataset [18] to predict photoluminescence
quantum yield (PLQY) and absorption and emission wavelengths. These
property predictors are used to guide the model in generating molecules
that were optimized for multiple fluorescent properties, leveraging an ad-
ditional 57 reaction pathways from the Enamine REAL space relevant for
fluorescent molecule design, along with the 13 Enamine REAL space re-
action pathways used by SyntheMol-RL. SyntheFluor-RL generated 11,590
candidate molecules, which were subsequently filtered and screened for pre-
dicted properties, structural novelty, and chemical diversity to identify the
top 19 compounds for synthesis and experimental validation. Among the 13
compounds that were successfully tested, our experiments identified three
distinct molecules, each derived from a different chemical scaffold.
This
demonstrates the utility of SyntheFluor-RL for diverse fluorescent molecule
scaffold design.

Results
SyntheFluor-RL was applied to fluorescent molecule scaffold design via three
main steps, as outlined in Figure 1: (1) training property predictor models
on the ChemFluor dataset, (2) generating and filtering output molecules
with SyntheFluor-RL, and (3) experimentally validating the output through
synthesis and testing.

The workflow begins
with training set processing followed by property predictor model develop-
ment. Next, SyntheFluor-RL generates molecules using the trained prop-
erty predictors within a chemical space of synthesizable molecules. These
molecules are then filtered based on calculated and predicted properties,
structural diversity, and novelty. Finally, selected molecules were synthe-
sized and experimentally validated.

2.1
Developing Property Prediction Models
The ChemFluor dataset [18] was processed to extract PLQY, absorption,
and emission values for 2,912 unique molecules dissolved in 63 different sol-
vents, resulting in 4,336 unique molecule-solvent pairs (Figure 2A). The
PLQY values ranged from 0 to 1, absorption values 247nm to 1026nm, and
the emission values 296nm to 1045nm.
Following curation, two machine
learning model architectures were trained to predict fluorescence properties:
(1) Chemprop (v1.6.1) [48], a graph neural network that processes molecu-
lar graphs and computed features, and (2) a multilayer perceptron (MLP),
which uses only computed molecular features (see Methods).
Two types
of features were tested for both models: Morgan fingerprints, which en-
code local chemical structures, and RDKit features, comprising 200 physic-
ochemical properties computed with RDKit [42] (Figure 2B). In both cases,
molecular features were augmented with four experimentally derived solvent
properties—polarizability (SP), dipolarity (SdP), acidity (SA), and basicity
(SB)—corresponding to the solvent used during experimental measurements.
Chemprop and MLP models were trained as either binary classifiers or
regressors, depending on the task. PLQY prediction was modeled as a bi-
nary classification task using a threshold of PLQY &gt; 0.5, while absorption
and emission wavelength predictions were modeled as regression tasks. All
models were trained using 10-fold cross-validation with an 80% training,
10% validation, and 10% testing split, completing in under 60 minutes on
an 8-CPU machine. PLQY models were trained on 3,055 molecule-solvent
pairs, absorption models on 4,202 pairs, and emission models on 4,333 pairs.
Across all three tasks (PLQY, absorption, and emission) and both model
architectures, the Morgan fingerprints outperformed the RDKit features
(Figure 2C-D, Supplementary Table 1). The Chemprop-Morgan and MLP-
Morgan architectures showed comparable performance on the PLQY clas-
sification task (Chemprop-Morgan: ROC-AUC = 0.895 ± 0.019 ; MLP-
Morgan: ROC-AUC = 0.896 ± 0.019). Chemprop-Morgan demonstrated a
slight advantage over MLP-Morgan for both absorption (Chemprop-Morgan
MAE = 13.118 ± 1.203; MLP-Morgan MAE = 13.657 ± 1.083) and emis-
sion (Chemprop-Morgan MAE = 18.951 ± 0.986; MLP-Morgan MAE =
19.829 ± 1.268) regression tasks. Based on its better performance across
most tasks, the Chemprop-Morgan architecture was selected for the scoring
function in the molecule generation process.
The presence of a π-conjugated system is critical for a molecule to be
fluorescent[47, 51], and larger π-conjugated systems reduce the HOMO-
LUMO gap, shifting electronic transitions to the visible spectrum. To incor-

porate this information, we designed an algorithm (see Methods) to calculate
the size of the largest network of connected atoms with sp2 hybridization in
each molecule’s molecular graph representation (Figure 2E).
2.2
Generating Molecules with SyntheFluor-RL
We developed SyntheFluor-RL (see Methods) to generate fluorescent molecule
candidates (Figure 3A). SyntheFluor-RL is an adaptation of SyntheMol-RL
[39], which is a generative model that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to
design easy-to-synthesize molecule with desirable properties. SyntheMol-RL
was previously applied to generate antibiotic candidates targeting Staphylo-
coccus aureus. Key to the SyntheMol-RL algorithm is its internal RL value
function, which is used to direct its selection of chemical building blocks.
Similarly, SyntheFluor-RL utilizes an RL value function to guide its selec-
tion process. However, its multi-parameter objective is altered to optimize
for four essential properties: PLQY, absorption wavelength, emission wave-
length, and sp2 network size.
During its generation process, SyntheFluor-RL computes a weighted
score for each candidate molecule, with dynamically adjusted weights for
each property to maximize the likelihood of generating molecules that sat-
isfy all four criteria (Supplementary Figure 1A). Success criteria are defined
for each of the four properties, and the weights are adjusted over time based
on the rolling average success rates, ensuring a balanced optimization of
photophysical properties. The trained Chemprop-Morgan property predic-
tion models are used in the reward function that evaluates each candidate
molecule, while an associated set of MLP-Morgan models are weighted in
the value function to score intermediate candidates and are trained during
generation. The MLP-Morgan architecture was chosen for the value function
instead of a matching Chemprop-Morgan architecture because SyntheMol-
RL with an MLP value function model is significantly faster than with a
Chemprop value function. As a result, SyntheFluor-RL rapidly evaluates
many combinations of building blocks using an MLP-Morgan model and
then performs a slower but more accurate evaluation of generated molecules
using a Chemprop-Morgan architecture.
Notably, to ensure that fluorescence properties were assessed under rele-
vant aqueous experimental conditions, all molecules evaluated by the Chemprop
and MLP models within SyntheFluor-RL were represented as a concatena-
tion of their Morgan fingerprint with four solvent features corresponding to
water: polarizability (SP), dipolarity (SdP), acidity (SA), and basicity (SB).
Initial generations using SyntheFluor-RL yielded a scarcity of molecules
